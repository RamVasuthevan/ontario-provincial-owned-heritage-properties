        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The Rouge River Bridge is of cultural heritage value for its design, associative, and contextual values with O.Reg.09/06. The Rouge River Bridge represents the historical theme of the expansion of railway services in Ontario in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This was a period of prosperity for railway companies across Canada and in this boom period the GTR took on the task of doubling the track from Montreal to Sarnia via Toronto. The construction of the Rouge River Bridge was undertaken as part of this project and the double track structure is clearly expressed. The introduction of a second track along the GTR corridor resulted in the construction of a new bridge to replace an earlier four- span structure at the Rouge River crossing. The design featured a one-span steel deck truss structure with stone abutments that was completed in 1898. The bridge was extended in length with the addition of two supplementary spans at either end of the bridge in 1902. The Rouge River Bridge is the second oldest surviving example of a railway bridge on the Metrolinx-owned portion\nof the Kingston Subdivision that comprises the Lakeshore\nEast rail corridor. It is one of small group of railway bridges\nin the Greater Toronto Area that retains a stone masonry\nsubstructure that was characteristic of early railway bridges.\nThe rail corridor first constructed by the GTR in the mid-\n1850s is a significant landform that extends along the shores\nof Lake Ontario in the southwest part of Pickering and the\nsoutheastern part of Toronto. The Rouge River Bridge is an\nintegral component of the corridor and through its physical\nform and materials contributes to the character of the rail\nline. The robust structure with its distinctive deck truss span\nand rock faced ashlar stone abutments is a physical\nlandmark at the mouth of the Rouge River. It is a highly\nvisible and well-known structure to the many users of the\nWaterfront Trail, the Rouge River and Rouge Beach. The\nbridge has continued in use as an active railway bridge for\nmore than 100 years and with its stone substructure and\ndeck truss and beam superstructure it is inextricably tied to\nits surroundings. The Rouge River Bridge has been\nmaintained and rehabilitated on a regular basis throughout\nthe course of its history. It has undergone some\nmodifications, but retains its dominant design character.\nThe Rouge River Bridge is of cultural heritage significance for\nits design value with O.Reg.10/06. The Rouge River Bridge is\nan important example of an engineering work in a provincial\ncontext. The design of the Rouge River Bridge comprises a\ndeck truss span with stone abutments that were completed\nin 1898. The bridge was extended in length with the addition\nof two supplementary spans at either end of the bridge in\n1902. Deck truss structures have not been used extensively\nin Ontario for railway or road bridges. The centre span is\nconsidered to exhibit an unusual deck truss design, and for\nthis reason, the top and bottom chords are not parallel.\nOther deck truss structures from the period typically used a\nlattice truss design with parallel chords. The stone\nabutments were characteristic of 19th century bridges;\nhowever, stone substructures would be considered to be an\nobsolete form of construction and are no longer being used\nas part of regular railway work. Many of the early railway\nbridges have been replaced or modified with superstructure\nreplacements and/or substructure widenings. The Rouge\nRiver Bridge is well preserved and retains its design character.",

Marie) and Thunder Bay. It is illustrative of the government’s investment in northern Ontario.  Locally it is significance for its continued association with the administration of justice in the District of Parry Sound since 1871 and its siting within the commercial district of the town. The combination of courthouse, land registry, jail, and jail superintendent’s residence on a single property is typical of justice and corrections in Ontario during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Three hangings occurred at the jail; the property may hold an unmarked burial currently unaccounted for relating to the hangings. \n\nThe courthouse is representative of late 19th century courthouses designed for northern Ontario. The 1889 section of the courthouse is a symmetrical building with Romanesque detailing, including round-arched second-storey window openings and raised-brick arches around the window and entrance openings. The 1922 addition, a two-storey rectangular block that extends to the rear of the 1889 section, follows this symmetrical approach with simpler and less formal detailing with rectangular window openings and cut-stone keystones and sills. The courthouse is a good example of the later work of Kivas Tully as Chief Architect and is also a good example of the work of his successor, Francis Heakes, who designed the 1922 addition.\n",

The late-19th century was a period of growth and expansion for railway transportation and railway companies in Ontario. As a result, the GTR undertook a doubletracking\nprogram of their railway corridor between Toronto and Montreal. The program required a series of structure renewals to accommodate the second track, including new\nstructures, rehabilitations and upgrades. The Petticoat Creek Culvert was constructed as a part of the structure renewals. The culvert’s association with the GTR and its important doubletrack expansion program relates is tied to its historic and associative value.\n\nAs a part of the renewals for the double-tracking program, GTR engineers designed and constructed an 18’0” by 13’0” culvert over the Petticoat Creek at Mile 314.25 (now 315.40).\nThe drawings for the culvert were signed by Joseph Hobson, Chief Engineer for the GTR at the time, most-notably known for his involvement in the design and construction of the St. Clair Tunnel. The culvert was designed and constructed as a masonry arch culvert, a design commonly used for short span railway structures at the time. Based on a review of similar culvert and short span bridges, the Petticoat Creek Culvert along this section of rail line, the culvert was larger than most culverts, however, it was also much smaller than others nearby. By comparison, the Dunbarton Subway, also located in Pickering Township, was much larger and includes a 25’0” masonry arch to accommodate a road to pass through the embankment.\nThe structure is one of many culverts that were constructed by the GTR along its rail corridor\nbetween Toronto and Montreal.\n\nThe culvert was constructed of quarry-faced ashlar stone with tooled/dressed margins. The masonry arch portion of the culvert incorporates the same materials and finished and includes a keystone located at the top of the arch. Coping stones placed above the arch also incorporate\nthe design and finishes and also include a 6” chamfer to the top of the structure. The squared stone used for the apron/retaining walls measure on average 3’0” by 2’0”. The used of stone for the structure represent a building material that was eventually phased out shortly after\nconstruction of the culvert. Stone was used mostly by railway companies for railway bridge abutments and piers, and culverts. By the early-20th century the use of stone became replaced with the more easily accessible and less labour intensive concrete materials. The culvert is one\nof the many surviving stone arch culverts along the line. However, shortly after the construction of the culvert, the use of concrete replaced widely replaced stone in new\nconstruction.",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Three historic settlement areas are found within the study area: Cedar Grove, Locust Hill and Hillside. Cedar Grove consists of properties along and adjacent to Reesor Road, north of Steeles Ave. Today the community consists of a handful of residential homes, a Mennonite Church, a community centre which is the former schoolhouse, and a former Blacksmith Shop. Locust Hill is located along Highway 7, including the former Highway 7 alignment on Locust Hill Road, historically built up around the CN Rail line. Today the hamlet consists of a cluster of residential homes at the intersection of Highway 7 and the CN Rail line, with a small church and cemetery outside of the study area. Hillside is found at the intersection of Old Finch Ave. and Sewells Road. Hillside includes the William A. Milne House, which was designated for architectural reasons as the only frame Gothic style house structure in Scarborough. The settlement area includes the winding, hilly alignment of Old Finch Ave as it crosses the Rouge River, and a board and batten Methodist Church, which was built in 1877.\n\nThe study area has been identified as consisting of overlapping cultural heritage landscape attributes, each of which contribute to the broader cultural heritage character of the Markham Agricultural Preserve lands. These landscapes include:\n• Indigenous and Early Canadian Settlement Transportation Routes\n• Early Canadian Settlement and Landscapes\n\nThe cultural heritage value and interest of the subject study area stems from the design/physical values, historical/associative values, and contextual values of these landscapes. The subject area has design value as a result of its long history of planned and evolved human settlement and population. This design value is expressed as an assemblage built heritage and cultural landscape elements evident in the remnant 19th century agricultural landscape, through the area historic settlement centres, through the significant and defining transportation routes and corridors that defined and shaped this settlement.\n\nSignificant design elements include: \n• Remnant 19th century agricultural features;\n• The historic settlement areas of Locust Hill, Cedar Grove and Hillside;\n• Transportation routes including Early Surveyed Roads and The CN Rail line;\n• Waterscapes of the Rouge River, Little Rouge Creek and Petticoat Creek\n\nThe study area also has historical value due to its association with Indigenous populations, and also retains historical value through its association with the Rouge River Valley and the nearby Carrying Place Trail as Indigenous transportation routes.\n\nEarly Mennonite settlement in the 19th century also contributes to the heritage value of this area. The Pennsylvanian Mennonites came to the Markham area looking specifically for trees such as black walnut, which they believed indicated soils suitable for farming. In 1804 Mennonite settlers from Pennsylvania arrived in Cedar Grove, headed by Peter Reesor. The hamlet of Cedar Grove developed out of the mills set up on the Little Rouge by Peter Reesor, who had erected saw and grist mills along the river by 1817. \n\nHillside was established in 1872 when a local miller named William A. Milne built a Gothic style home on the hillside along the Rouge River. The contrast, the historic settlement of Locust Hill didn't rise to prominence until the arrival of the Ontario and Quebec Railway in 1884, linking Toronto with Peterborough. Agricultural products, including flour, brushes, livestock and milk were shipped out of Locust Hill from the surrounding farms. \n",

The building was enlarged and converted for use as a hotel. Additions extended the building to the east (rear) and north up to Front Street. Open space and outbuildings were retained at the rear of the property along Front Street. The site was vacant in the\nfirst part of the 20th century from 1910 to 1922.

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The property at No. 409 Front Street is considered of heritage interest for historical, architectural and contextual reasons. It was listed in the City of Toronto\nInventory of Heritage Properties in 1976. The Palace Street School section of the building dating in part to 1859 is one of the earliest free schools in Toronto and is\nthe only survivor of the early schools built by the Toronto Board of Education. It is one of the few surviving buildings in Toronto designed by contractor and\narchitect Joseph Sheard, who went on to become the Mayor of Toronto. After the building was sold in 1890 it went on to be used as a hotel and later for manufacturing and warehouse purposes. The Palace Street School and the stone\ndistillery building at Gooderham & Worts Distillery dating to 1859 are the oldest structures in the West Donlands area.\n\nThe school building relates to the former residential neighbourhoods in this part of St. Lawrence Ward. The housing was removed in the early 1900s when the railway companies purchased much of the land to the east of Cherry Street. The school is the only surviving building in this area that is associated with the 19th residential development. The building is dramatically sited on the southeast corner of Front Street East and Cherry Street and is important in relationship to No. 425 Cherry Street on the northeast corner, also listed in the City of Toronto\nInventory of Heritage Properties.\n\nIn its design, the building is a composite of styles relating to the various periods of construction and alterations. Although altered, the school, hotel and warehouse sections are still readily discernible. The building has suffered from the loss of the turret at the northwest corner. The school retains elements of the Gothic Revival style, while the hotel addition relates to the Queen Anne style. The warehouse is a vernacular structure displaying construction techniques typical of the 1920s. ",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The St. Clair Avenue West Bridge is directly associated with the Northwest Toronto Grade Separation\nProject in the early twentieth century. The current bridge was built in 1931 as part of the grade\nseparated crossing and rehabilitation of St. Clair Avenue West. This was a significant improvement to\nrailway and roadway infrastructure in Toronto that contributed to economic and population growth\nwith improved traffic flow and the expansion of streetcar service to Keele Street.\nThe St. Clair Avenue West Bridge is an early example of a two-span rigid concrete frame bridge and is\nthe oldest example of this style of construction in the Metrolinx Master Bridge List. The structure is the\nsecond longest rigid concrete frame structure in the Metrolinx Master Bridge List, and measures 40.2\nmetres in length. The cast-in-place structure features concrete abutments, bas-relief paneling, and\ndecorative brackets supporting the trainman’s walkway. Rigid concrete frame structures were not\ncommonly used to carry rail lines over municipal roads, as they generally required thicker decks and\nlonger construction times than concrete slab bridges. However, the innovative internal reinforcement of\nthe subject bridge’s deck facilitated a thinner deck, which improved the clearance height below the\nstructure and reduced both construction costs and time.

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Henley bridge was opened to the public in 1938 by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. In 1939, the Henley Bridge was used by the monarchs to celebrate the opening of the Queen Elizabeth Way. The QEW was Canada’s first inter-city highway. The highway impacted small communities greatly by providing the means of a more direct route of transportation to cities that allows for urbanization, economic growth and the development of new technologies. The Henley Bridge plays a vital role providing a structural connection over 12 Mile Creek, by allowing QEW traffic to travel to and from St. Catharines. \n\nHenley bridge is one of the six open-spandrel bridges built in Ontario. Other bridges of this design include the Etobicoke Creek Bridge, the Severn River Bridge, the Bronte Creek Bridge, Credit River Bridge and the Sixteen-Mile Creek Bridge. The bridge is designated as the fifth oldest open-spandrel bridge and the second largest in Ontario. \n\nHenley Bridge is also recognized for its unique architecture. In addition to its six-span, concrete open-spandrel arch, the bridge also consists of accessory designs that depict historical events in Ontario at the time of the bridge’s construction. One design is the prow of a stylized “Viking” ship shown from stepped stone pedestals on each side of the bridge. This design is paying homage to the Royal Canadian Henley Regatta that passes through the area. Signs of allegiance to the British Empire are also shown in the lion sculptures at both ends of the bridge with embedded royal insignias. The historical timeframe of this bridge’s construction is in the World War II era, and Canada’s international allegiance to the crown is shown in the structural design by incorporating British symbolism. \n\nThe Henley Bridge shows characteristics of a heritage structure as stated in O.Reg. 9/06 and O.Reg. 10/06 making it a heritage bridge. Some criteria from the Ontario Heritage Act includes a landmark, a high degree of craftsmanship, and historical significance on a provincial or national level.\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The Macdonald Block has provincial heritage value for its history, urban design, architecture, landscape, and public art.   \n\nThe Macdonald Block expresses the centralization of the power and functions of the Provincial Government after the Second World War. Its size, complexity, and accessibility illustrate the principal themes of a rationalized and modernized bureaucracy, the expansion of government, and the growth of provincial programs and the civil service. The incorporation of a large collection of commissioned public art, the many counter-service offices (now removed), and the accessible landscape design, all reflect that era’s theme of transparency and openness of government and the policy of providing a regional service centre in Toronto.  \n\nThe Macdonald Block is a landmark building and has value as an innovative example of urban design, with its balanced three-dimensional geometry of vertical towers and horizontal blocks. The building, a conservative strain of International Style modernism (a fusion between modernist vision and provincial government conservatism of that era), is integrated into the landscape with a series of interconnected designed landscapes, set-back entrance plazas, and pedestrian linkages. Heritage value is enhanced by the materials and finishes, many of which were regionally sourced.\n\nThe excellence of architecture and urban design can be attributed to Douglas Glenn Creba, Chief Architect, Department of Public Works (who outlined the form of the central buildings – four office tower blocks tied together by a low central core), the external architects who completed the design work and managed the construction project - the consortium ‘The Associated Architects’ (Gordon S. Adamson & Associates, Allward & Gouinlock, Mathers & Haldenby, and Shore and Moffat & Partners), the landscape firm of Sasaki Strong and Associates, consulting engineers H.H. Angus & Associates (mechanical), C.D. Carruthers and Wallace Consultants (structural), and R.P. Allsop & Associates (electrical), and  Perini Western Ltd., who constructed Macdonald, Ferguson and Hepburn blocks, and Pigott Project Management Ltd., who constructed Mowat and Hearst blocks. \n\nThe Macdonald Block collection of Canadian artworks and sculptures commissioned and/or selected for the project contributes to the significance of the property; successfully realizing Premier John Robarts’ vision to promote ‘a greater appreciation of the work of Canadian artists and to enhance the architecture of the building’. Many artworks fulfilled specific provincial themes and locations assigned by committee and were composed within the art climate of the time, concerned with technique and media as much as style, by such artists as A.J. Casson, Jack Bush, Harold Town, and Gerald Gladstone.\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The Union Station Complex is of cultural heritage value or interest for its historical, design and contextual values.\nHistorical Values\nThe Union Station Complex demonstrates historic values at the local and provincial levels.\nConstruction of the massive facility was a response to the rapidly expanding rail networks in Ontario during the early 20th century and corresponding urban growth of Toronto. Railways had a dramatic effect on emerging urban centres, particularly in south-central Ontario and Toronto’s dominance in this area was a result of its numerous rail connections. Railways also played an integral role in the industrialization process -- opening up new markets while, at the same time creating a\ndemand for fuel, iron and steel, locomotives, and rolling stock. By 1927 when Union Station officially opened, it was handling 180 trains per day and between 60,000-75,000 passengers making it the busiest in the province.\nUnion Station is directly associated with several organizations and individuals significant to the City of\nToronto and to the province. Chiefly, Canada’s major railway companies (CPR, GTR/CN), the TTR and its engineer John Robert Ambrose as well as the architectural firm of Ross & MacDonald, and architect John Lyle.\nDesign Values\nThe Union Station Complex demonstrates design values at the local and provincial levels.\nThe station building (headhouse) is a representative example of Beaux-Arts transportation facility, embodying the main tenets of the style in a single structure. This includes the exceptional quality of its design, symmetrical plan, prominent siting and use of exaggerated Classical forms and detailing. Further, it is a rare example of Beaux-Arts architecture executed at the full, monumental scale associated with the style. It is the largest and most opulent railway station in Ontario.\nDesigned to represent one unified structure, the station building is three distinct units, with the station function occupying the centre section and office functions to the east and west. The front façade is 230 metres (752 feet) and features a colonnade of 22 gigantic Roman Doric columns. The steel frame structure is clad in Indiana limestone and demonstrates a hierarchy of treatment with an embellished front façade (Front Street), plainer east (Bay Street) and west (York Street) facades, and unadorned rear façade.\nThe trainshed is a representative example of a Bush trainshed which was used in larger Canadian railway stations. Toronto’s trainshed is notable for its through-traffic design. The trainshed was planned as part of the 1913-14 design of the station building.\nContextual Values\nThe Union Station Complex has contextual values at the local level. Occupying the entire block between Bay and York streets, the Union Station Complex is the defining feature of the area. As the first of several large-scale buildings in the area, its scale, style and extensive use of limestone created the precedent for subsequent buildings including the Royal York Hotel and the Dominion Public Building. In addition, the Union Station Complex is one component of a larger transportation network\nwhich includes the high-level viaduct and associated subways (bridges) as well as the signal towers at John, Scott and Cherry Streets.\nAs a hub for passenger train travel at the local, provincial and national levels, the Union Station\nComplex is well-known to residents of and visitors to Toronto.",

The bridge is part of the Lakeshore West rail corridor, built by the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1855 and presently used by CN, VIA Rail, and Metrolinx. The current bridge superstructure was built by the GTR in 1900 and 1902. The northeast abutment is located adjacent to high-rise residential properties and the Oakville GO Station while the southwest abutment is located adjacent to low-rise commercial estates and a residential subsdivision. Green space and woodlots flanking the Sixteen Mile Creek generally characterize the land to the southeast and\nnorthwest of the bridge, with the exception of Cornwall Road approximately 138 metres to the southeast of the structure.

Sanitoriums were medical facilities that were founded on the premise that fresh air, bed rest and diet were key components of curing disease. As such, the location of sanitoriums took into consideration the natural and aesthetic qualities of the area, opting for rural areas with scenic character. The founding of the Muskoka Sanitorium in Gravenhurst marked the creation of the third sanitorium in the world and the first in Ontario. It was the first free public tuberculosis hospital in the world. Upon the discovery of streptomycin, treatment of tuberculosis changed and the use of sanitoriums in Ontario declined.

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Barnum House is a local landmark situated on a treed country road within a rural landscape. It is built on a slight rise in the land with a white picket fence surrounding the property.\n\nEliakim Barnum, born in 1784 in the United States, immigrated as a late Loyalist to Haldimand Township, Upper Canada, in c. 1807. He purchased 100 acres of land on the southern half of Lot 23, Concession 1, in 1812, from James Norris. Despite the sale, Norris continued to live in his house, already built on the property. It was accidentally destroyed by fire, set by soldiers quartered in his home, during the War of 1812. Norris was left financially devastated and sold the other half of Lot 23 to Barnum, in 1814. In about 1819, Barnum built a two-storey neoclassical structure on the foundations of Norris’ home. The family operated a grist mill, tavern and distillery, but the majority of their revenue came from farming. Eliakim lived to the age of 94, and was a prominent member of his community; as Justice of the Peace, Lieutenant-Colonel of the local militia, and a founder of St. George's Anglican Church in Grafton. After Eliakim’s death, the property transferred to his eldest son, Smith. In 1917 Smith Barnum’s sons sold the property to Harry and Rose Prentice. During the Prentices' tenancy, Eric Arthur, founding member of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario (ACO) made several visits to the home, and, it was bought by the ACO in 1939. The ACO restored the house and it opened as Ontario’s first house museum in 1940. An image of the house is still used as the logo for the ACO. With Canada’s focus on World War II and a lack of funds, the museum closed a year later. In 1958, Haldimand Township purchased the property from the ACO for $1.00 and re-established the house as a museum. The house was purchased by the Ontario Heritage Foundation in 1982, restoration was undertaken, and it was opened as a house museum, in 1991. The museum is currently not open to the public.\n\nBarnum House is a notable neoclassical designed timber frame house, built in c. 1819. It has a two-storey centre block and two one-storey symmetrical wings. The front façade of the house is clad in flushboard, but all of the other elevations are clad with clapboard. The centre block is decorated with pilasters, elliptical arcading over the second storey windows and a pediment with a false fanlight. The pilasters flanking the six-panelled entrance door support a 12-paned semi-circular transom within a broken pediment. Windows on the front façade are single hung, 12 over 12 paned units, with shutters. Triglyphs and metopes adorn the frieze of the centre block and its wings. \n\nOriginal interior elements include the east and west wing’s fireplaces, surrounded by an “Adamesque” (a design type popular in the United States and Scotland in the late 18th century employed by Loyalist settlers) mantel, and the kitchen’s cooking fireplace and bake oven cover nine feet of the south wall. The large room on the second floor, was used as a ballroom, and has three windows overlooking the property. In 1840, heating stoves were installed in the home and an east kitchen was added. In the 1870s, a woodshed was attached to the back of the centre block. In 1991 the house was restored and an addition was constructed at the north end of the house. \n\nBeginning in 1982, archaeologists from the Ontario Heritage Foundation carried out a number of excavations on the Barnum House property. Findings included evidence that the James Norris house was destroyed by fire around 1812. Over 36,000 artefacts were recovered. Artefacts dating from the Barnum period indicated that the family lived an elegant lifestyle from the 1820s to the 1850s. The sites of the former west verandah, north woodshed, carriage house and east kitchen were also excavated. \n\nSource: Ontario Heritage Trust Property Files.\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Sited in the community of Williamstown, the Bethune-Thompson House borders the Raisin River. Williamstown has maintained many of its 19th century homes and the Bethune-Thompson House is in close proximity to other museums including the Nor’wester and Loyalist Museum and Sir John Johnson Manor. The site itself, in addition to the main house includes an extant drive shed and the 1840s workers’ cottage, which was purchased by Murdoch in 1871.\n\nThe property on which the Bethune-Thompson House is located was originally granted to Peter Ferguson in 1784, a Scottish immigrant to the American Colonies who served in the King’s Royal Regiment of New York. As a Loyalist settler to Charlottenburgh Township he settled on the west half of Lot 50, Concession 1 and built a log house. In 1804, Loyalist settler Rev. John Bethune (1751-1815) purchased the land from Ferguson and built a house, to which he later moved and attached the Ferguson log cabin to form a side wing of his house. Bethune was founder of St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church in Williamstown and was the first Presbyterian minister in Upper Canada. He also founded congregations and preached at Cornwall, Lancaster, and Martintown. In 1815, just weeks after the death of Rev. Bethune, his wife Véronique (Wadden) Bethune, sold the house to David Thompson (1770-1857). Thompson, a retired North West Company partner mapped much of western Canada. He also worked for the Boundary Commission, mapping out the border between British North America and the United States. The Thompson family lived in the home from 1815 to about 1836, when the family incurred financial difficulties and left for Montreal. \n\nThe property was sold to Farquar McLennan and his descendants lived in the house until 1937. In 1937, William Smart, the McLennan’s farm manager, purchased the home and Mae Smart (daughter-in-law to William) sold the property to the Ontario Heritage Trust in 1977 to ensure the preservation of the property. The house underwent a major restoration in the mid 1980s.\n\nThe one-and-a-half storey Bethune-Thompson House displays early French Canadian building techniques used in its construction. The 1784 log house was added to Bethune’s new home and was used as a kitchen, where a large stone hearth remains. The walls of the log cabin were constructed using a French Canadian method called “poteaux sur sole.” Logs in vertical positions were held together by horizontal plates located at the top and bottom. In the 1804 construction of his home (used as a manse) Bethune used other French Canadian construction methods, “colombage pierrotté”, a system of post and beams made from heavy timber which are filled in with stone, bricks or sticks and mud, and the use of “tôle à la canadienne” roofing, creating a diamond pattern using tin. The walls of the house were then covered with pebble dash and painted white. The symmetrical wings and front central pediment give the home a Neoclassical look, and Thompson’s later improvements such as the verandah add a Regency flavour. The interior contains two examples of hand printed wallpaper put up by Bethune which have survived due to the installation of false walls by Thompson. A significant amount of the Georgian woodwork survives, and can be seen in the front door, staircase, and parlour mantel. The layout of the centre block has the rooms arranged in a ‘U’ shape around an entrance and stair hall. The house also has symmetrical side wings, the 1784 log house and a 1914 north wing damaged by fire in the 1930s. \n\nArchaeological excavations were conducted at Bethune-Thompson House in 1980, 1981 and 1993 and uncovered more then 36,000 artifacts. A number of mixing bowls, a pharmaceutical jar which dates from 1730-1830, a plate rim with a feather-edge decorative motif, attributed to the Wedgwood Factory, were all some of the items found on the property.\n\nSource: Ontario Heritage Trust Property Files\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Situated at the intersection of Mill and Russell Streets, the Duff-Baby House is located within the historic core of the former Town of Sandwich. Its visual relationship with the Detroit River demonstrates the importance of the river in the late 18th century fur trade and the form of the remaining property reflects the French method of land division with long, narrow, one-acre plots lined along the river’s edge. Although the property formerly boasted a store, a stable, a wharf, and an orchard alongside the main house, none of these structures remain. Current accessory uses are limited to The Duff-Baby Interpretive Centre which is located slightly south of the main house. \n\nThe Duff-Baby House was a late-18th century mercantile establishment and it played a role as a military headquarters during the War of 1812. Many influential people have resided within its walls during the 19th and 20th centuries. \n\nThe house was constructed in 1798 for Alexander Duff, a Scottish fur-trader and a member of the Detroit fur-trading firm of Sheppard, Leith and Duff. Duff operated his business from the house for nine years, but decided to relocate to Amherstburg in 1807 when the fur-trading industry in Sandwich began to decline. Upon Duff’s departure, the house was sold to James Baby, a prominent Upper Canadian politician, military officer, and descendent of an important seigniorial family in Quebec. As a colonel of the militia during the War of 1812, Baby was one of 600 soldiers captured by American troops. The house survived attack, occupation and looting by the Americans, but required numerous repairs following the war’s end. Subsequent to the death of James Baby in 1833, the house was occupied by his son Charles, who served as Mayor of Sandwich from 1859 to 1866. Other prominent owners in the history of the house include James van Cleve, a Great Lakes ship captain and accomplished amateur artist who bought the house in 1879, and Dr. William Beasley, a respected local doctor who began residency in the house in 1909. The house remained in the Beasley family until it was transferred to the Ontario Heritage Trust in January 1979. The house currently stands as the oldest building in Windsor and one of the few remaining 18th century buildings in Ontario.\n\nThe Duff-Baby House is one of the best preserved examples of Georgian domestic architecture in Ontario. While the layout and proportions are typical of Georgian design, the house also contains various characteristics common to late-18th century French Colonial architecture, such as the timber wall framing with brick infill (colombage briqueté) and the steeply-pitched and dormered roof. The house has experienced numerous changes over its long history, and photographic evidence has documented the existence of at least four different verandas and three successive cladding materials (clapboard, stucco, and asbestos shingles). From 1991 to 1995, the Ontario Heritage Trust carried out a restoration project to recover the appearance of the house to the years following the War of 1812. As part of the restoration work, an addition was built on the south side of the house in reference to the kitchen wing (c. 1800) that was destroyed by fire in 1908.\n\nThe grounds of the Duff-Baby House have experienced several seasons of archaeological excavations and the Ontario Heritage Trust has recovered over 75,000 artifacts from the property since 1988. Archaeological work has also helped to reveal characteristics about the evolution of the landscape, including the location and character of the house’s front porch, cisterns, stone drains, kitchen wing, and outbuildings. In the mid-1990s, the information gained from the archaeological research was utilized in the restoration of the house. \n\nSource: Trust Property Files, Ontario Heritage Trust.\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The Elgin and Winter Garden Theatre Centre is located in downtown Toronto at 189 Yonge Street and contributed to the early commercial district of Toronto along with the Pantages Theatre (1921)which was also designed by Thomas Lamb. Today, the area is in Toronto’s tourism district, near the Eaton Centre, multiple restaurants, and Yonge-Dundas Square.\n\nThe Elgin and Winter Garden Theatre Centre is associated with theatre magnate Marcus Loew, owner of one of the largest vaudeville/movie theatre chains in North America and founder of MGM studios. He brought his theatre chain to Canada with the opening of the Yonge Street location in late 1913, and soon after began building theatres across the country. Vaudeville came into popularity during the 1880s, and provided inexpensive entertainment to the masses. The Elgin (called Loew’s Yonge Street Theatre until 1978) opened with much fanfare on December 13, 1913, and the Winter Garden followed on February 16, 1914. Performances consisted of a series of variety acts and silent movies. The theatres saw their share of famous performers including George Burns, Gracie Allen, and Charlie McCarthy. \n\nThe more prestigious Winter Garden Theatre had assigned seating, shows on weekends and evenings only, and higher admission prices. Vaudeville declined as “talkies” made their way into Toronto in 1927, resulting in the closure of the Winter Garden in 1928. The Elgin was converted to use as a movie house in 1930. Today, the restored theatres hold performances of all kinds, and stands as the last operating double-decker theatre in the world. The theatre centre is also associated with New York City architect Thomas Lamb, who designed 16 theatres across the continent from 1914-1927.\n\nThe Elgin and Winter Garden Theatre Centre is significant for its Thomas Lamb double-decker or stacked design, the only one ever built in Canada. The narrow Yonge Street facade connected to less expensive street frontage along Victoria Street, where the majority of the theatre structure was located. The domed ceiling of the Elgin Theatre is suspended from the floor of the Winter Garden, seven stories above, by a series of steel rods. The narrow two storey Yonge Street facade is a traditional Edwardian design with pilasters, engaged columns, and three Roman arched windows. Theatre patrons enter into a long, narrow, richly decorated lobby lined with scagliola columns with a crimson, brass, and gold colour palette. This colour scheme carries into the Elgin Theatre with rows of crimson seats, carpeting, and draperies. The panels and plaster decoration are burnished in patina glaze. The domed ceiling replicates much of the detail of the rest of the theatre, only on a larger scale with garlands, ribbons, and masks. Access to the Winter Garden Theatre is by way of the grand staircase or hand operated passenger elevators which maintain their original signage “Elevators for the Winter Garden”. Decoration of the smaller Winter Garden is completely different from the Elgin, with a whimsical rooftop garden atmosphere. Garden murals of roses, morning glories, and climbing ivy cover the walls, and structural columns are decorated to resemble tree-trunks. The ceiling is adorned with lanterns and over 5,000 beech leaves and branches. The sounding board mural is a scene of blue sky and white clouds with mountains in the foreground. \nThe Ontario Heritage Trust restored the historic theatres to their previous grandeur. 65,000 sq. feet of new ancillary space, designed by architect Mandel Sprachman was also added.\n\nDuring construction over 60 ceramic and glass vessels were recovered. As a result, a small archaeological excavation of a nineteenth century foundation well took place. An additional 500 artifacts were recovered providing evidence of occupation of this site prior to the construction of the theatre complex. \n\nSource: Ontario Heritage Trust Property Files\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Enoch Turner Schoolhouse is associated with the introduction of free schools in the province and its connection to Enoch Turner (1792-1866), a wealthy brewer and philanthropist. The Schoolhouse was the first free school in Toronto; parents were not required to pay a fee to send their children to this school. When the Province introduced the Common School Act of 1847, municipalities were given the power to raise funds for public education via taxation. City aldermen were unwilling to introduce public taxes for education, and as a result all of the schools that benefited from any kind of public support were closed for a year. This motivated Enoch Turner to fund the first entirely free school in Toronto. The Schoolhouse was designed with the intent of educating children from the neighbourhood near Turner’s brewery. The Schoolhouse was known as the Ward School. Little Trinity Church donated the land for the Schoolhouse, and in 1849 the Schoolhouse opened with space for 240 pupils. In 1850 school trustees were elected to oversee educational funding, and free public education officially began in Toronto in 1851. When the school was transferred to the City, it was renamed Trinity Street School. In 1859 the school and property were given back to Little Trinity parish and from the 1860s to the 1960s the Schoolhouse served as a parish hall and Sunday school for Little Trinity Church. The Schoolhouse was saved from demolition in the early 1970s and was restored for use as a living history site and conference centre. \n\nEnoch Turner Schoolhouse is an early example of Gothic Revival architecture in the City of Toronto. The Schoolhouse has a church-like appearance, and the design is attributed to architect Henry Bowyer Lane, who also designed Little Trinity Church (1843). The Schoolhouse is rectangular in plan, one storey high with a gable roof and brick parapet on the east façade. The Schoolhouse is clad in red brick and trimmed with buff brick, stone and wood. The east (main) entrance has a shallow porch with a gable roof. The tongue and groove door at the front entrance is accentuated by a stone pointed arch with voussoirs and a wood transom with a carved trefoil pattern. The entrance also incorporates lancet windows with pointed wood hood moulds and lug sills. There is a date stone over the door that reads “SCHOOL HOUSE ERECTED BY ENOCH TURNER, A.D. 1848.” The attic has a very small lancet window with stone trim in the pediment. The north wall contains five bays divided by buff-brick pilasters, and in the centre a segmental-arched opening has a pair of reproduction tongue and groove doors with reproduction hinges. The west wing of the Schoolhouse was added in 1869, and designed by architects Gundry and Langley to provide space for the Sunday school. The west wing features a hip roof with cross gables. Originally a ventilator lantern with a steeple and finial were on the roof, but now only its base remains. The west wing’s exterior walls feature lancet windows at different heights with sandstone sills. The interior of the west wing features a square web of exposed timber trusses each in the shape of a shallow arch supported on four cast iron columns. This exposed structure is painted dark green. C. 1900, the south wall was removed from the original schoolhouse and widened by one bay. Both the 1869 and c. 1900 additions are complimentary in design to the original 1848 schoolhouse. \n\nSource: OHT Property files\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The original address of Lambton Lodge was 154 Beverley however, in 1889-90 the street numbering system changed with the current address of 186 allotted to the residence. The neighbourhood changed in the early 20th century, as Toronto’s wealthy began moving west and north to the suburbs of Parkdale and Rosedale. Today the house is situated within Chinatown and to the south of the University of Toronto campus.\n\nGeorge Brown House is significant for its association with Father of Confederation, The Toronto Globe founder and leading abolitionist, George Brown (1818-1880). Brown was born in Alloa, Scotland and immigrated to New York City in 1837, then to Upper Canada in 1843. In March of 1844, George Brown launched the first issue of The Toronto Globe, forerunner of The Globe and Mail, supporting ideas of Responsible Government. Brown played a major role in both the Charlottetown and Quebec Conferences, two crucial events in which Canada’s leaders met to execute plans for Confederation. In March of 1880, Brown was shot in his office by a disgruntled employee, although his wound was not severe, he died on May 9, 1880 of an infection. \n\nDuncan Coulson purchased the home in 1889 for $31,000 and after making improvements, he and his family moved into the home in 1891. Duncan Coulson worked as the General Manager of the Bank of Toronto and served as its President from 1911 until his death in 1916. From 1920 to 1956 the Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB) used the house as its headquarters. A three-storey addition was built onto the rear of the house during this period and functioned as a skills training centre for the blind. Since 1986 the house has been owned by the Ontario Heritage Trust. Much of the original architecture and interior fabric has been restored, and improvements were made between 1987 and 1989 to support its current use as a conference centre and office space\n\nGeorge Brown House is significant for its Second Empire design with Italianate detailing. Although Brown had retained William Irving to design his house, it was modified by Edward Hutchins, architect and builder. George and Anne Brown named their three-storey, 9000 square foot, red clay brick house Lambton Lodge. Second Empire features include the grey slate mansard roof and pavilion massing. The interior of the house follows the common Georgian centre hall plan, with room placement of public rooms on the main floor and private rooms on the second and third floors. The house has 12 of the original 15 fireplaces, some with elaborate mantels, the most notable being the morning and drawing room’s polished marble mantels with the initials of George and Anne Brown entwined on the cartouche. Remnants of George Brown’s library show the built-in dark walnut cabinets that used to house his collection of books. \n\nThe Coulson family made a number of changes to the house, hiring Toronto architect David Brass Dick to design the Art Nouveau dining room and the ornate front hall fireplace. Cast iron radiators were installed throughout the house to replace the earlier air duct, gravity-based heating system. A five-bay veranda was also added on the facade by the Coulsons in 1890 and a single-window dormer on the front facade was enlarged to a triple-window dormer.\n\nIn 1987 and 1988 archaeological excavations uncovered over 5,000 artifacts providing insight into the construction of the George Brown House as well as the landscape surrounding the house. Structural evidence was discovered below ground of a unique architectural feature, a “shell” wall, which functioned as a double foundation. Highlights of the artifact finds include a collectible pint corker containing the letters “William Robertson”, a silver ring and amber bead attributed to the Coulson period, and an 1850s St. George penny token. \n\nSource: Ontario Heritage Trust Property Files\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Located slightly south of the intersection between Front and Bay Streets in the south-eastern area of Moose Factory, the Staff House is a landmark building within Canada’s oldest continually occupied English-speaking community. The community, which is only accessible by water and air, consumes the southern half of Factory Island, and is located directly across the Moose River from the Town of Moosonee. The positioning of the Staff House at the edge of the island is significant in the interpretation of the site as a trading post, as access to James Bay is gained only 18 km north of the settlement. Other significant heritage resources located near the building include the St. Thomas Anglican Church (1864), the HBC Cemetery (c.1802), and the buildings of the Centennial Park Museum. \n\nThe HBC Staff House is associated with the early operations of Canada’s oldest corporation, the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC). Established in 1670, the HBC began as a fur trading enterprise and later evolved into a trading and exploration company with operations spanning Canada and parts of the United States. The HBC established its first trading post at the mouth of the Nelson River during its first year of operation, and in 1673, a second post was founded on the Moose River. The early history of this second post was quite riotous, with the British relinquishing ownership to the French in 1686 and then recapturing it ten years later, only to burn it to the ground. In 1730, a new post was built by the HBC, one mile upstream from the first Moose River fort. This post expanded significantly in the 1820s following a merger between the HBC and its principle fur-trading rival, the North West Company. The Staff House was constructed between 1847 and 1850 to provide suitable shelter to the doctors, ship captains, clerks, and secretaries recruited from Britain on five-year work contracts. These workers, known as officers, lived on the first floor of the building during the summer and moved into the second floor bedrooms during the cold winter months. The staff house retained its use as a residence until it was transferred to the Ontario Heritage Trust in 1977. The building is currently the oldest surviving HBC officer’s house in Canada and the oldest structure in the James Bay Lowlands.\n\nThe HBC Staff House employed the traditional British ship-building technique for its construction. This technique, which was utilized to build many of the early HBC buildings at Moose Factory, was characterized by laying horizontal squared logs one over the other and pinning them together with steel spikes. Oakum, a tar and jute fibre mixture used chiefly for caulking seams in wooden ships, was also used in the construction process to chink the joints between the timbers. Due to the harsh climate of the area, the house was clad with clapboard siding for extra weatherproofing and two large back-to-back fireplaces were built at the centre of the house. Following the turn of the 20th century, the interior layout of the house was altered several times. The most obvious of these alterations was to the building’s fenestration, with the doors and windows on the main level of the east elevation being repositioned to accommodate the new interior arrangement. \n\nThe grounds of the HBC Staff House were the site of two seasons of archaeological excavations in 1979 and 1980 in which the Ontario Heritage Trust recovered over 40,000 artifacts. The recovered artifacts represent evidence of trade between the Native and British populations, as well as the lifestyles of the HBC employees at the Staff House. Included within the list of recovered artifacts are large quantities of glass trade beads, ceramics, and clay tobacco pipes.\n\nSource: Trust Property Files, Ontario Heritage Trust\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Located on the east side of Museum Street between Front Street and Centre Road, the McLeod House is situated in the old fur-trading centre of Canada’s oldest continually occupied English-speaking community. Although the house has been relocated from its original site, its current position within Centennial Museum Park reflects the historical setting typical of HBC workers’ houses, with the front of the house facing the river. The McLeod House is situated between two other relocated buildings, the Turner House (1863-64) and the Sackabuckiskum House (1926), and forms part of a row of workers’ houses that chronologically reflect three separate eras in the housing of HBC employees. Guided by historical precedent, the houses contain small yards suitable for growing vegetable gardens and are spaced far enough apart to minimize the danger of spreading fire. Other historic resources existing within the Centennial Park boundaries include the HBC Blacksmith’s Shop (1849-51), the HBC Powder Magazine (1865-66), and the HBC Cemetery (ca. 1802). \n\nThe McLeod House is historically significant for its association with the McLeod Family, a family with deep roots in the operations of the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) post at Moose Factory. Early in the 1820s, the HBC initiated a practice of constructing detached dwellings for its married workers. These dwellings allowed married workers the independence and privacy that would not otherwise be available in the shared accommodations offered to HBC staff. Accordingly, the McLeod House was constructed in 1889-90 by HBC carpenter William McLeod for his newly married brother, HBC shipwright George McLeod. After approximately 20 years of living in the building with his wife, George was transferred to another trading post and his brother William, the original builder of the house, took ownership in 1910. William and his wife Ellen raised ten children in that house before they eventually transferred ownership to their son, Herbert. Herbert, who lived in the house all of his life, worked for the HBC as a general labourer for 30 years and was one of the last tradesmen in Moose Factory employed by the HBC. A strong believer in preserving Moose Factory’s heritage, Herbert was made the first custodian of the Centennial Park Museum and upon his death in 1981, left his house to the Ontario Heritage Trust. The house is currently operated as an interpretive museum site by the Moose Factory Tourism Association and is open to visitors during July and August.\n\nThe McLeod House utilized shipbuilding techniques in its construction. This technique is exclusive to Moose Factory, where most of the 18th and 19th century buildings were constructed by shipwrights. It is characterized by laying horizontal squared logs one over the other, pinning them together with steel spikes, and then chinking the joints with oakum, a tar and jute fibre mixture used chiefly for caulking joints in the hulls of ships. Due to the harsh climate of the area, the house was covered with clapboard siding and possessed a compact design that made it easy to build and heat. Heat from the first floor woodstove radiated through the main floor and rose naturally to the second floor where it would warm the bedroom loft. The most distinguishing feature of the McLeod House is the standing seam metal pan roofing that was installed in 1918 after being salvaged from the demolition of a c. 1811 HBC sawmill. At the time of its installation, metal roofing was highly prized for its fire-proofing properties.\n\nSource: Trust Property Files, Ontario Heritage Trust\n",

In 1903, a French fur trading company based in Paris, the Révillion Frères, set up a trading post on the western bank of the Moose River, directly across from the existing Hudson’s Bay Company’s (HBC) post on Factory Island. The French traders of the Révillion Frères provided tough competition for the HBC by offering more generous compensation (in trade goods) for traders’ furs. As a response, the HBC was forced to make special arrangements with trappers to retain their loyalty. It was under these circumstances that the Sackabuckiskum House was built in 1926. In an attempt to maintain the services of prominent and influential Cree fur trapper Ham Sackabuckiskum, the HBC assisted in the construction of a building to be used by the Sackabuckiskum family as a summerhouse. Although Cree fur trappers and their families led nomadic lifestyles tending to their trap lines during the winter, they often spent the summers around Moose Factory, fishing and doing odd jobs for the HBC. This tendency made the offer of a summerhouse particularly attractive. The building retained its use as a summerhouse until the death of Ham Sackabuckiskum in 1960. Facing demolition in 1983, the house was acquired by the Ontario Heritage Trust and moved to the Centennial Park Museum, where it currently operates as an interpretive museum run by the Moose Factory Tourism Association. The Sackabuckiskum House is the only surviving Cree summerhouse in Moose Factory.\n\nThe Sackabuckiskum House was one of the first buildings in Moose Factory to utilize balloon-frame construction; a technique in which wall studs rise the full height of the building rather than the height of a single storey. Built by Ham Sackabuckiskum with the assistance of HBC workers, the house retained the traditional proportions and window and door locations of the 19th century log homes built a century earlier by HBC staff. The only variation from the traditional design was the dormer window located centrally on the front facade of the building. Although the main components of the building were constructed from local resources, certain materials, such as the asphalt roofing and the glass for the windows, were not available in Moose Factory. To collect these supplies, Ham Sackabuckiskum paddled his canoe 180km to Smokey Falls, the nearest community where they could be purchased. Ham then paddled back to Moose Factory with the supplies in his canoe while navigating the challenges of several sets of rapids. It is believed that former HBC carpenter William McLeod built the windows and doors of the Sackabuckiskum House.\n\nSource: Trust Property Files, Ontario Heritage Trust\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Sir Adam Beck 1 Generating Station (originally known as the Queenston-Chippawa Hydro-Electric Development) is determined to be a provincial heritage property of provincial significance.\n\nSir Adam Beck, an advocate for readily accessible electricity for the public and municipalities in Ontario, successfully convinced the Ontario government to create Ontario’s Hydro-Electric Power Commission (HEPC) and he was appointed as the Chair in 1906. He was knighted by King George V in 1914 for his promotion of electricity and development of transmission lines. When it was opened by Sir Adam Beck on Dec. 28, 1921, the Queenston-Chippawa Development (as it was known between 1922 and 1950) was the largest hydroelectric power station in the world and the first to be built by the HEPC. This included construction of the 13.2 km long power canal through the City of Niagara Falls. The specific design characteristics of the canal resulted in the creation of specialized machinery for the task.\n\nThe generating station is strategically located at Queenston, where the drop from the top of the escarpment to the Niagara River is approximately 100 metres, double the height found at other locations. Locating the station at Queenston enabled it to produce approximately 80 per cent more power than if it was located near Niagara Falls. Its site on the Niagara Escarpment and the Niagara River, and the layout of its associated 20.5 kilometre canal, was chosen to successfully provide the highest horsepower possible to operate the turbines in the powerhouse. The power capacity of SAB 1 far surpassed any generating station constructed before it. In order to maintain a high volume of water under the lowest water conditions and to meet the varying demands, technology, advanced for the early 20th century, was required to achieve the precise measurements and angles of the canal and forebay design. In the construction of the canal and powerhouse, the largest ever manufactured, mechanical shovels and specially designed concrete forms were employed.\nSAB 1 itself was designed with Beaux-Arts styling to be the show piece of the HEPC. This is exhibited in its grand exterior and design elements typical of early 20th century civic and commercial structures, but uncommon in industrial buildings of the time.\n\nAs a landmark structure in the surrounding area there is high visibility to and from the property by both vehicular and pedestrian traffic utilizing the Niagara Parks Waterfront Trail system and the Niagara Parkway, which runs directly through the property. SAB 1 is also clearly visible from the eastern side of the Niagara River in the United States, from the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge, and from boats on the Niagara River.",

The Turner House is one of several buildings within the confines of the Moose Factory Centennial Park Museum, which is a site commemorating the history of the area as a Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) trading post. The one-and-a-half-storey, clapboard-clad building was constructed in 1863-64 and originally served as a residence for the family of Joseph Turner, a retired HBC employee. \n\nIn June 1983, ownership of the Turner House was transferred to the Ontario Heritage Trust, thereby conferring protection to the heritage elements of the house.

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Located on the east side of Museum Street between Front Street and Centre Road, the Turner House is situated in the old fur-trading centre of Canada’s oldest continually occupied English-speaking community. Although the house has been relocated from its original site, its current position within Centennial Museum Park reflects the historical setting typical of HBC workers’ houses, with the front of the house facing the river. The Turner House is situated west of two other relocated buildings, the McLeod House (1889-90) and the Sackabuckiskum House (1926), and forms part of a row of workers’ houses that chronologically reflect three separate eras in the housing of HBC employees. Guided by historical precedent, the houses contain small yards suitable for growing vegetable gardens and are spaced far enough apart to minimize the danger of spreading fire. Other historic resources existing within the Centennial Park boundaries include the HBC Blacksmith’s Shop (1849-51), the HBC Powder Magazine (1865-66), and the HBC Cemetery (c.1802). \n\nThe Turner House is significant for its association with Joseph Turner, an employee who worked for 64 years at the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) post at Moose Factory. Believed to be the son of Philip Turner, a distinguished British surveyor, and a Cree woman from the HBC Brunswick House post, Joseph joined the HBC at the age of 15 as a steersman on canoe expeditions. He later learned the trades of coopering, carpentry, and sailing to ensure that he was in constant demand, but it was his reliability and honesty that lead him to become indispensable to HBC officers. Turner eventually achieved the position of interpreter for the HBC Chief Trader (the highest rank achievable by a man of mixed ancestry) and the HBC built him this house upon his retirement in 1864. Following Joseph Turner’s death in 1865, the house continued to be used as a residence until the late 1930s when it was moved to the Mission grounds and served as a Bible Study Hall. The frequent movement of buildings such as the Turner House was common around this time, as several homes would be shifted to new locations each year using logs as rollers and a team of oxen or horses. Despite being relocated four times prior to acquisition by the Ontario Heritage Trust in 1983, the house remained in the ownership of the Turner family until it was moved to the Centennial Park Museum. The house is currently operating as an interpretive museum site by the Moose Factory Tourism Association and is open to visitors during July and August. It is the oldest known HBC worker’s house remaining in Canada.\n\nThe Turner House employed shipbuilding techniques in its construction. This technique is exclusive to Moose Factory, where most of the 18th and 19th century buildings were constructed by shipwrights. It is characterized by laying horizontal squared logs one over the other, pinning them together with steel spikes, and then chinking the joints with oakum, a tar a jute fibre mixture used chiefly for caulking joints in the hulls of ships. Due to the harsh climate of the area, the house was covered with clapboard siding and possessed a compact design that made it easy to build and heat. Heat from the first floor woodstove radiated through the main floor and rose naturally to the second floor where it would warm the bedroom loft. The most distinguishing feature of the Turner House is the presence of the horizontal board cladding that adorns the roof. In 19th century Moose Factory, roofs were often covered with pine boards such as these, as few men could be spared from shipbuilding operations to engage in the time-consuming undertaking of splitting shingles.\n\nSource: Trust Property Files, Ontario Heritage Trust\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Inge-Va sits in a park-like setting in downtown Perth. The property has extensive gardens including rose bushes descended from those planted by Rev. Michael Harris who lived in the home from 1824 to 1833. Rev. Harris laid out the gardens and paths that surround the house, while the Radenhursts (subsequent tenants) planted the black locusts and built the stone wall in the 1870s. Both Ella and Cyril Inderwick created extensive gardens and a circular driveway in the 1930s.\n\nInge-Va is significant for its association with three prominent families in Perth. The house was constructed for Perth’s first Anglican Minister, Rev. Major Michael Harris, in 1824. He left the house in 1833 and rented the property to lawyer Thomas Mabon Radenhurst, who subsequently purchased Inge-Va in 1839. In 1833 Upper Canada’s last fatal duel was fought near Inge-Va between Robert Lyon and John Wilson, local law students. Lyon, who was Radenhurst’s nephew and boarder, died at Inge-Va following the duel. Edith Radenhurst, widowed in 1854, continued to live in the house and between 1855 and 1873 lost three of her 10 children to tuberculosis, one to typhoid and one to drowning. Edith died in 1878, leaving son William and daughter Annie, to live in the house until 1894. Ella Inderwick and her three children moved into the house in 1894 and gave it its current name, Inge-Va. It means ‘come here’ in the Tamil language of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) where Ella Inderwick had lived with her husband. Ella’s son Cyril, a local historian, helped establish the Perth and Lanark Historical Society, and became a founding member of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario in 1932. He lived in the house until his death in 1962. His wife Winnifred donated Inge-Va to the OHT in 1974. Through a life-tenancy agreement she remained in the house until her death in 1989. \n\nInge-Va is an example of a mixture of Late Georgian, Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture in Ontario. The house was built of Ontario sandstone and laid in coursed rubble. The original house consisted of a one-and-a-half storey building with a layout common throughout the Rideau Canal Corridor with a central hall plan, two front reception rooms and two rear rooms on the main floor. Upstairs there is a master bedroom, a boys’ room, a girls’ room and a service wing accommodating the kitchen on the main floor and a nursery and servants’ rooms on the second floor. The front of the house has a Neoclassical doorway flanked by two multi-paned windows on each side. Five Adamesque fireplaces grace the main rooms of the house. The Radenhurst family enlarged the kitchen in the 1840s and built a Regency Style verandah. Due to continued illness in her family in the 1870s, Edith Radenhurst removed the verandah, and installed French doors off the dining room and off the upstairs hallway, which required the creation of a Gothic pediment above the front door. This brought more light and air into the house. Apart from a metal roof and modernization of the kitchen and bathroom, the house has remained largely unchanged. In 1994-95, funds from the Ontario Government allowed the OHT to restore the house to the 1870s period in keeping with the collection of Radenhurst furniture and the archaeological artifacts associated with the house.\n\nInge-Va’s archaeological value is one of its most important characteristics. Excavations carried out from 1987-1994 recovered approximately 50,000 artifacts, 15,000 of which came out of an abandoned privy. This pit contained over 350 china objects and 280 glass objects. Items recovered from the privy include 10 different sets of tableware, 280 bottles, 71 wine glasses, 108 pharmaceutical and toiletry bottles, 16 chamber pots and seven toiletry sets. These items were discarded in an attempt to rid the house of tuberculosis. These objects provide a unique insight into how medical threats were addressed in the latter part of the 19th Century. \n\nSource: OHT Easement Files\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Located on Highway 2 just east of the Village of Maitland in a rural area of Eastern Ontario, Homewood is situated on a slight rise overlooking the St. Lawrence River. A section of the property was also used by the St. Lawrence Fruit Station. Generations of Jones’ built a variety of outbuildings on the property, but only the ice house, log shed, barn and apple shed survive.\n\nHomewood is associated with six generations of the Jones’ family and illustrates the experience of Loyalists settlers in becoming an influential family with a successful working farm and orchard. Dr. Solomon Jones, born in 1734, was living at Fort Edward, New York at the outbreak of the American Revolution. He enlisted with the British forces in Jessup’s Rangers and served as a surgeon’s mate. In 1785 he settled in what became Augusta Township, in the colony of Quebec (in 1791 became Upper Canada) as a Loyalist, with his wife Mary Tunnicliffe and widowed mother. They built a log cabin on the St. Lawrence River where the growing family lived until 1800, when Solomon moved his family into a large stone home. In addition to his duties as the only doctor from Kingston to Cornwall, Solomon was a surgeon in the militia, a member of the Second Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, and in 1800 he was Judge for the District Court of Johnstown. Upon Solomon’s death in 1822, the property was passed to his son Dunham who served in the War of 1812 and the 1837 Rebellion. In 1876 Andrew Jones inherited the property upon his father’s death and expanded the farm, supplying milk to cheese factories, making butter, and selling produce at the Brockville market. In 1905 Andrew’s son Harold inherited the property and developed the Jones Fameuse Apple in 1900, which won a medal at the Pan American Exhibition in Buffalo. Justus took over operation of the farm in 1941, however, in 1951 he sold the property to Du Pont of Canada, continuing to live in the house until his death in 1972. At this time, Du Pont took full control of the property and house, proposing demolition. After a successful campaign by the Grenville County Historical Society, Du Pont donated the house and 11 acres to the Ontario Heritage Foundation (OHF) in 1974. Jones’ family descendent Monica Jones offered her oral history which assisted the OHF in interpreting the history of the house for the public. In 2001, the OHF purchased a number of Jones family heirlooms and furniture for display at Homewood. \n\nHomewood is significant for its Georgian domestic design executed by Montreal builder and contractor Louis Brière. Although the fieldstone house is predominantly Georgian, it has French Canadian architectural elements on its exterior including its window shutters, metal work, and steep pitched roof. On the interior, pine was used for the flooring, cupboards and mouldings. The original main floor consisted of a surgery, parlour, bedroom and kitchen. In the 1820s, after Solomon’s death Dunham turned the surgery room into a Regency drawing room adding arches and decorative trim. Dunham also added a back kitchen and converted the previous kitchen into a formal dining room. In 1927, Harold Jones divided the house into a duplex after his son Justus’ marriage to Willa Sarney. A large west wing addition was built in the 1930s with stone that matched the original house. \n\nSince 1979, archaeological excavations have been undertaken at Homewood and have uncovered over 30,000 artifacts. The focus of archaeological work has been to identify outbuildings on the property. As a result, the smokehouse, privy, ash pit, drive shed and carriage shed have been identified and investigated archaeologically. Artifacts recovered include building hardware, medicine bottles, and large quantities of 19th century ceramics.\n\nSource: Ontario Heritage Trust Property Files\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Located at 1444 Queen Street East, the Ashbridge property and surrounding landscape have evolved extensively over the last 200 years. In 1794, the land east of the Don River was covered in forest. Today the cottage is situated in an urban landscape. A number of homes and out buildings were built by the Ashbridges, although the log cabin dwellings, the 1809 Georgian home, and a 1913 house have been demolished. A sunken lawn and weeping willow mark the location of a former creek which the family used to paddle in to get to Lake Ontario. The family also kept beautifully landscaped grounds with an extensive flower and vegetable garden. In 1912 six acres of the Ashbridge property was sold and the Duke of Connaught School was built, which put an end to much of the farming activities. \n\nThe Jesse Ashbridge House so named for the Ashbridge family, the only family in Toronto to have lived continuously for two centuries on land they settled. Sarah Ashbridge, a widow from Pennsylvania, immigrated to York (Toronto) in 1793 with sons Jonathan and John, daughters Elizabeth Wilcot and Mary McClure, and their husbands and children. In the spring of 1794 they settled east of the Don River on lots laid out by John Graves Simcoe. They cleared Part Lots 7, 8, and 9 for farming and built a log cabin only 60 meters from Lake Ontario. Both Jonathan and John were farmers, and pathmasters (supervisor of highways), both married in 1809, and that same year, both built their families two-storey frame homes. Jonathan’s son Jesse, a farmer and active in the Methodist Church, inherited Part Lot 9, the section of land to remain in the family until the 1990s. In 1853, Jesse commissioned local architect, politician and future mayor of Toronto (1871-72), Joseph Sheard to design his home, which still stands today. Jesse died in 1874, but his second wife Elizabeth continued to live in the house until her death in 1918. Jesse’s son Wellington was educated as a civil engineer, and his work took him across the country. He returned to Toronto in 1913 to help his mother with the subdivision of their estate, which she had begun years before in 1893. Wellington’s daughters, Dorothy and Betty donated the house, and property to the Ontario Heritage Foundation in 1972, however, Dorothy continued to live in the home until 1997. \n\nThe Jesse Ashbridge House is a simple Regency design with Neo-classical elements. The red brick is laid in Flemish bond and sits on a high stone foundation. The original five-bay cottage had a hipped roof and decorated chimneys. The arcaded treillage veranda is still intact, as is the front entrance’s eight panelled door with moulded pilaster casing, the tooled limestone lintels, and six-over-one double-hung sash windows. In 1900 Elizabeth Ashbridge added a second storey, giving the cottage a Second Empire mansard roof, and in 1920, a two-storey addition to the north wall designed by Wellington Ashbridge gave the home its current appearance. Interior details include heavy architrave mouldings, and baseboards in pickled oak in the central hall. The kitchen’s 1854 bake oven, cooking hearth and built-in pantry cupboards all survive within the basement walls of lake stone and original lath and plaster finish.\n\nThe Ashbridges owned such a large tract of land and constructed so many buildings on the property over a 200 year period, that archaeological excavations have uncovered over 120,000 artifacts. Archaeological evidence of the 1790s log cabin and 1809 frame house (demolished 1913) have been found on the property. Evidence of First Nation occupation has also been recorded, including hearth features and artifacts dating back thousands of years.\n\nSource: Ontario Heritage Trust Property Files\n",

The south and north headwalls have a similar appearance based on an examination of photographic documentation. The culvert arch lacks a prominent keystone, and the arch stones are neatly cut to join tightly with the stone courses in the face of the headwall. The arch is circular, with the sidewalls constricting slightly as they approach the culvert floor. The floor is poured concrete and is flat, suggesting it was also used as an underpass for livestock or agricultural equipment.

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Based on visual observation of similar culverts in the comparative sample, the Mile 54.61 Culvert appears to be a similar size and design to the Mile 35.88 stone arch culvert, which was determined to retain cultural heritage value due to its large size relative to its location (ASI 2019e). While a similar size to the Mile 35.88 stone arch culvert, the subject culvert at Mile 54.61 features a concrete floor with a farm path leading northeast from the north headwall, suggesting it also functions as an underpass crossing. Of the known stone arch culverts included in the comparative sample, the subject culvert at Mile 54.61 of the Kitchener rail corridor is the only example of a stone arch structure that also appears to function as an underpass structure for people, farm equipment, or animals.  Further, based on a review of available information regarding structural rehabilitations and continued use as a rail structure, the subject culvert is one of only two structures in the comparative sample of an apparently unmodified mid to late nineteenth-century stone arch rail culvert that still functions as a railroad structure (including the similar Mile 35.88 stone arch culvert).  Based on a review of all available data, the Mile 54.61 Culvert is not significant on the Kitchener rail corridor in terms of date of construction or style but is significant in terms of size and is a representative example of an unmodified nineteenth century stone arch railway culvert. \n ",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Cultural Heritage Value \nThe Macdonell-Williamson House is significant as an example of early 19th century settlement in the Ottawa River Valley; it was a centre for milling, merchandising, warehousing, and shipping. The house was built by John Macdonell (1768-1850), a Loyalist, judge, military commander, member of the Upper Canada House of Assembly, and Northwest Company partner. The Macdonell family immigrated to the American Colonies from Scotland in 1773 and became members of Loyalist forces and moved to Upper Canada following the American Revolution. Macdonell joined the Northwest Company in 1793 where he was employed for almost 20 years. In 1812 he retired and in the spring of 1813 purchased a large plot of land in the Township of Hawkesbury from Joseph Fortune. He constructed a number of buildings on the property to support his business interests, the most substantial being a stone mansion built for his wife Magdeleine Poitras, a Métis born in Manitoba, and their children. The house was often used as a gathering place for Gaelic festivals and Northwest Company fur traders made Poplar Villa a point of rest. In 1882 the house was sold to the Williamson’s, and remained in the family until it was expropriated by Ontario Hydro in 1960.\n\nThe Macdonell-Williamson House demonstrates traditional design for 1817, through its Georgian and Palladian influence. Constructed by an unknown builder, the two-storey, five-bay, symmetrical house is made of randomly coursed local stone. Built on a gentle slope, the basement is exposed at the east elevation giving the impression of a three storey house. Two distinguishing features that once existed were a porch leading up to the elevated front entrance and a domed lantern, with Captains walk, set atop the hipped roof. The lantern allowed Macdonell to view his property and traffic on the Ottawa River, and made the house a landmark on the river. The interior of the house was impressive, based on the Georgian centre hall plan, with simplified elements of Robert Adam (1728-92) or “Adamesque” design in the plasterwork and woodwork of the ballroom, dining and drawing rooms. The use of Adamesque design shows influence from his homeland of Scotland and upbringing in America where the style also enjoyed great popularity. The second floor ballroom, 13 bedclosets, and 10 fireplaces are indications that Macdonell was a man of influence and wealth. The arrangement of sleeping quarters in groups of two or three bedclosets around a common sitting room, dressing room and fireplace is a feature found in the larger houses of the time. The house underwent significant changes during the Williamson’s tenancy, with the addition of a 19th century wrap-around verandah on the east and south elevations and removed in the 1970s.\n\nSeveral excavations have taken place on the property resulting in the uncovering of 90,000 artifacts. Archaeological potential on the grounds still exists. Highlights of the finds include hundreds of buttons, ceramic plates, and an 1860s Turk’s head clay pipe. The foundations of the general store and an ice house remain. \n\nMacdonell built his house on a bluff on the Ontario shore of the Ottawa River, a major Northwest Company fur trade route, at a point where the Carillon Rapids required voyageurs to make a portage. He designed his house to be a landmark, with the shiny tin roof of the cupola visible from about a mile away. Macdonell took advantage of these travellers’ hiatus and the growing needs of the hamlet of Pointe-Fortune by establishing a commercial centre consisting of a gristmill, general store, warehouse, and sawmill. \n\nSource: Property Files, Ontario Heritage Trust\n",

The Speed River Bridge at Mile 48.50 is 493foot long and approximately 18.4 feet wide and designed by the Canadian Bridge Company. The bridge is a seven span deck plate girder bridge used to traverse over Wellington Street, Macdonell Street and Elizabeth Street along with the Speed River. The bridge has stone abutments, each incorporating stone decorative projecting elements. Each span consists of four girders connected with bolts. The spans differ in length with spans 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 spanning 67’-3”, span #4 spanning 87’6” and span #7 spanning 76’3”. The substructure consists of six piers that are composed of a pair of rectangular limestone masonry columns laid with mortar. A steel cap beam sits atop each of the two limestone columns. The piers were constructed with the intention of accommodating a double track configuration, however, only one track has been constructed and a metal grated walkway has been affixed to each side of the superstructure.  A photograph of the bridge from 1887 suggests that the columns were taller with a decorative piece on top of the columns. Plans for the structure from 1905 suggest that the original c.1857 piers were used/altered when the replacement superstructure was constructed. In addition, when span #3 was replaced a builder’s plaque was imprinted with a 1948 building date on the replacement steel beams. The Mile 54.61 Stone Arch Culvert is located along the Kitchener rail corridor approximately 375 metres west of Woolwich-Guelph Townline in the Township of Woolwich (historically on Lot 96 of the German Co. Tract in the Township of Waterloo in the County of Waterloo). The Mile 54.61 Culvert was constructed in the mid-late nineteenth century and is not known to have undergone any documented structural rehabilitations. ",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The Speed River Bridge at Mile 48.50 is a representative example of a steel deck plate girder structure with stone piers and abutments. The bridge was constructed in 1905, replacing an earlier bridge constructed c.1857 and incorporating the stone piers of the previous bridge into the current design. Plate girder bridges proliferated throughout the mid-twentieth century and were commonly used to support railways in both urban and rural settings. Based on a review of comparative structures with stone abutments, the subject bridge is the longest bridge of this type in the Metrolinx system and was built around the same time as the earliest stone structures that remain in the system today. However, it is not considered to be a rare or unique example of a steel deck plate girder bridge as there are earlier and larger examples of this bridge type on masonry substructure in Ontario. The bridge is historically associated with the Kitchener rail corridor, which was built in the 1850s by the GTR and which later became the CNR. The bridge was constructed in 1905, replacing an earlier bridge that was constructed in this location c.1857 and reusing its stone piers (though in an altered state). The construction of this bridge was important in providing access to the City of Guelph from the Greater Toronto area, and would have been instrumental \n  \nin the early growth and development of the commercial and industrial sectors of the City. Historically, the Speed River Bridge at Mile 48.50 would have been an important piece of infrastructure that supported the development of downtown Guelph. This bridge and its predecessor have provided rail access to downtown Guelph since 1857. Visually, the bridge is a prominent structure when entering or departing downtown from the east, and historically would have been a significant part of this experience as Macdonell Street ran parallel to the bridge, directly underneath. Due to its prominent location and association with Macdonell Street, its size and stone piers and abutments and its history, the Speed River Bridge at Mile 48.50 is a landmark within downtown Guelph.

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Mather-Walls House is significant for its association with the Mather family, the Walls family and the early development of Keewatin. Mather-Walls House was commissioned by John Mather (1828-1907) for his son David (1854-1947) in 1889. John came to Canada from Scotland in 1857 to manage a sawmill near Ottawa. He and his son David arrived in the Lake of the Woods area in 1879 and founded the Keewatin Lumbering and Manufacturing Company. John Mather built the first Presbyterian church in the community, was chairman of the school board and opened a branch of the Bank of Ottawa. The Mather family was instrumental to the growth of the community, modernizing town life with enterprises such as the Citizens’ Telephone and Electric Company, the Keewatin Power Company and the Ottawa Gold Milling and Mining Company. In 1893 David Mather moved to Kenora, vacating the house. The house was rented out in the summer months until 1906 when John Walls (1857-1933) purchased it for himself and his family. Walls lived in the house until his death. The house remained in the Walls family as a summer residence until purchased by the Ontario Heritage Foundation in 1975. The house was researched and restored and since 1985 has been operated by the Lake of the Woods Historical Society under an agreement with the Trust. \n\nMather-Walls House is a significant example of the Queen Anne style with Shingle style elements. Built of wood and designed by Winnipeg architect George Browne, it is the only intact survivor of three almost identical houses Browne designed for John Mather. Two storeys high, the house is capped by a truncated hipped roof sheathed in wood shingles and crowned by a small arcaded balustrade and yellow brick chimney. Lacking a principle façade, the house was designed to be viewed from all directions, with the west, north and south façades distinguished with gabled frontispieces. The land falls away from the house to the west revealing the pink and grey granite foundation above which are vertical framing panels filled with clapboard, and two horizontal belt courses running beneath the window sills on each storey. The second storey is sheathed in fish scale shingles that flare slightly at the belt course. The frontispieces have decorated vergeboards and are capped in crested gables. Their tympanums feature decorated bands, square panels and diagonal board and batten siding. The southwest corner has a canted window and a window capped with a wooden pediment and two volutes. The west and north side verandahs are trimmed with beveled posts, moulding bands, brackets and horizontal grills with thin turned spindles. The yellow and dark brown colour scheme dates to the 1920s. The interior is organized around a central hallway staircase with railings similar to the exterior balustrade and each newel post is topped with a set of rosette ornaments and an urn. Four-paneled doors with pressed relief hardware are used throughout. The double parlour has a semi-elliptical arch with corner beads capped with small finials and high baseboards. The one remaining fireplace has a carved wood mantel and glazed tile surround and hearth. Simple stained glass windows are present throughout and the kitchen contains tongue and groove wainscoting. The second floor has four bedrooms and a washroom with a ca. 1920 toilet and metal tub. \n\nArchaeological investigations were conducted in 1979-80 and 1984 uncovering 27, 413 artifacts. These include glass, earthenware, pharmaceutical and window glass, nails and general middens.\n \nMather-Walls House is situated on a hill set back from the road overlooking Portage Bay to the northwest. Mather-Walls House retains its commanding views of the former mill and the community’s original business district. Its elevated location free of obstructive vegetation, still conveys the wealth and prestige of its builder.\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "McMartin House is located at 125 Gore Street East, in downtown Perth near other historic buildings including Inge-Va, also owned by the Ontario Heritage Trust. The property’s original white picket fence with finial capped posts was removed in 1884 and subsequently reconstructed in 1976.\n\nMcMartin House is significant for its association with Daniel McMartin, a historic figure in Perth, who moved there in 1823 to become the town’s first lawyer. Born to Loyalist parents in 1798 and raised in nearby Martintown, he was educated at Osgoode Hall in Toronto. Daniel built McMartin House in 1830 with money he inherited from his father and married Charlotte Mathilda Morgan in 1836, the daughter of a wealthy American family. The couple and their four children lived in McMartin house until it was seized by the sheriff in 1868 for non-payment of debts. Daniel McMartin died a year later after a brief illness. \n\nMcMartin House is also associated with William O’Brien, a wealthy boot and shoe manufacturer with three children, who was elected to town council in 1896 and lived at the house from 1871-1883. Subsequently, another prominent figure in Perth, Dr. William Grant and his family, lived in the house from 1883 to 1919. The house is associated as well with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kingston, during the period 1919-1972 who made the most drastic changes to the property, converting it to a parish hall and renaming the building St. John’s Memorial Hall. Since 1974 the property has been leased to the Perth and County Senior Craft Fellowship.\n\nMcMartin house is an excellent example of the American Federal style in Canada. This style was popular in the United States between 1780 and 1820 but was very rarely seen in Canada. The house is built of red brick in Flemish bond, with marble trim and quoins. Round and semi-elliptical arches form a layer across the symmetrical facade and the house has a standing seam tin roof (replicating original fer blanc or sheet iron coated with tin roofing) ornamented with two lanterns and a large central cupola (replicas based on originals). Interior details such as window trim and mouldings were inspired by the published architectural renderings of Asher Benjamin, an influential designer in the Greek Revival style. In 1883, mahogany trim was added to the east room on the first floor and in the northeast room on the second floor, as was a coal burning furnace. It was also at this time that the original roof-top lanterns were removed and replaced with boxed skylights and the cupola was shortened in height. In 1890, Dr. Grant built a two storey kitchen wing in the rear of the residence replacing the original basement kitchen. In December 1906 a furnace fire spread through the air vents and damaged the west side of the house. Joists on the ground floor were replaced as was sub-flooring and flooring. The exterior brick was replaced to halfway up on the second storey rear elevation. In 1907 a new furnace with hot water radiators was installed and the west side damaged by the fire was repaired. In 1925 the stairs to the third floor were removed and the second floor walls were removed to convert the building to a parish hall. In 1931 the exterior marble steps were removed and installed at Inge-Va, a few blocks away.\n\nAfter the acquisition of the house by the Ontario Heritage Foundation in 1972, the basement was excavated by archaeologists. During this excavation a dressed stone floor below the wood flooring and a fifteen inch oval brick drain trench running away from the east side of the house were discovered. Under an 1890 rear porch addition, dressed stones were identified as being coping stones from a brick garden wall that once ran along the east side of the building. Further archaeological excavations were carried out in 1987 and uncovered 1,653 artifacts. \n\nSource: OHT Easement Files\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The St. Clair Avenue West Subway has physical, associative and contextual cultural heritage value. The structure displays strong associative value as part of the Northwest Toronto Grade Separation project. The Northwest Toronto Grade Separation was one of four large-scale grade separation projects undertaken in the City of Toronto in the first decades of the 20th century. During this period, the West Toronto Junction in the northwest part of the city experienced significant industrial growth. The expansion of factories in combination with the network of railroad tracks crossing the area resulted in significant traffic problems. The City of Toronto began lobbying for grade separation in the northwest part of the municipality in the early 1920’s. Unlike the other grade separation projects that entailed a linear rail corridor, the Northwest Toronto Grade Separation project was complex and comprised several lines that were owned by CN and CP. The grade separation work allowed the TTC to expand its streetcar network and enhanced connections between West Toronto Junction and other parts of the city. The St. Clair Avenue West Subway is directly associated with the Northwest Toronto Grade Separation project, a significant city building activity in Toronto. It is also linked to CN, an organization of importance to the West Toronto Junction. The structure reflects the work and ideas of CN’s Central Region bridge engineering office which was under the leadership of Thomas T. Irving, Chief Engineer and Charles P. Disney, Bridge Engineer. Both have been noted for their innovation and expertise in concrete grade separation structures of this type.  \n \nThe structure has physical and design value as a result of the engineering methods used by CN for its construction. For the grade separation, CN began to use precast concrete deck slabs to construct rail bridges under traffic in the early 1930’s and by 1933 they were \nusing this method regularly for grade separations structures. St. Clair Avenue West Subway is an early example of this method in CN’s Central Region and it consists of a castin-place concrete for the substructure and reinforced, precast concrete deck slabs for the superstructure. The concrete slabs were generally designed to hold one rail of a single track.  This structure carries 4 active tracks across the expanse of St. Clair Avenue West. \n \nThe St. Clair Avenue West Subway has contextual value as one of the last remnants that maintains the historic industrial character of the area. The property is historically linked to the rail corridor, St. Clair Avenue West, and the remaining industrial structures. The property is prominently located on St. Clair Avenue West. The grade separation lowered the street below the structure so as you approach the Subway from either side it becomes the most prominent feature. The restriction of traffic flow caused by the later addition of a streetcar lane further emphasized the presence of the structure and as a result the St. Clair Avenue West Subway has become a landmark in the area.

The style is more tempered than that of major office buildings of this style within Canada during this period. The one storey nature of the original building is of a much smaller scale than the monumental examples of the Victorian Italianate style in keeping with the Commercial Renaissance Revival style and the overall expense that would be outlaid for a small office building.

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Located at the corner of Queen and Kings Streets in the centre of Niagara-on-the-Lake, Niagara Apothecary is part of the downtown Heritage Conservation District designated under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act, as an area of historical and architectural significance. The apothecary contributes to the historic streetscape and stands out as an important example of confederation-era commercial architecture.\n\nNiagara Apothecary is significant for its association with the development of pharmaceutical practice in Ontario, six generations of chemists and detailed accounts of medical treatment, during a 140 year period. The Niagara Apothecary opened in 1820 under the proprietorship of Rodman Starkwather. The current structure was built in 1853 and was likely originally used by lawyer and Judge E.C. Campbell, as an office. It was altered in 1866 to its present appearance and, in 1869, was bought by pharmacist Henry Paffard, for use as an apothecary. He operated his business there until 1901 when the building was bought by pharmacist James De Witt Randall. Both De Witt Randall and Paffard were important local businessmen and served as mayors of the town. The apothecary closed in 1964. At that time the pharmacy had been in continuous operation for 144 years, 95 of which were at the current location, and was owned by six different pharmacists, five of whom were apprenticed to predecessors. It was the longest continually operating pharmaceutical practice in Ontario. It was in operation before the regulation of the pharmaceutical industry, in 1871, when the Pharmacy Act was enacted and the Ontario College of Pharmacy was created. The ledgers, account journals, cashbooks and prescription books dating from 1833-1964 indicated the concerns of the chemists, the diseases they encountered, the treatments they administered and revealed important information regarding pharmaceutical practice, treatments, and diseases in Ontario during the 19th and 20th centuries. \n\nNiagara Apothecary is an example of confederation era commercial architecture with Italianate elements. Constructed in 1853, as a frame building, covered in clapboard, the building was transformed in 1866, from a modest Georgian building, with the construction of a front addition with Italianate elements. These changes focused on the street-façade. The large central door has a rounded-arch window, separated from two display windows by wood pilasters. The large round-arch display windows have cable or rope glazing bars forming an arcade with roundels above, a typical Italianate feature. The façade also has corner brackets embellished with pendants, an entablature with projecting shelf, and dentils beneath an entablature, with a fascia. \n\nThe interior has remained largely unchanged and provides an excellent example of an 1860s apothecary interior. Interior features include the original serving and dispensing counters, wall cases, deep cupboards, display shelves, and the ca. 1893 cash register. The elaborately carved black walnut prescription counter with an 1867 clock is well preserved. The interior also features three elaborate chandeliers (originally gasoliers) which hang from diamond-shaped plaster ceiling medallions, as well as much of the original pharmaceutical ware.\n\nNiagara Apothecary underwent a limited archaeological assessment in 1988 which yielded over 2,700 items from the rear yard of the property. These were mostly in the form of brick debris (remnants of the foundation of a building on the site dating from the 1830s), and glass fragments from pharmaceutical bottles and windows. There was also evidence of a small gasworks at the rear of the property, indicating the production of pharmaceuticals and other by-products on site, that could be produced from coal. This is suggestive of the widespread practice of chemists in the 19th century to produce their own medicines in-house.\n\nSource: OHT Property Files.\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The Ontario Heritage Centre is situated in Toronto’s financial and commercial district. In 1907 when Gouinlock was asked by the Canadian Birkbeck Investment Company to design the building, this district was still rebuilding from the disastrous 1904 fire. In the years after the fire, a new Toronto skyline emerged with taller buildings of modern fire-proof construction. The property at 10 Adelaide Street was located in a highly desirable setting near King Street’s financial buildings, on a main street equipped with streetcar tracks. \n\nThe Ontario Heritage Centre is significant for its association with George W. Gouinlock, who was commissioned to design the Canadian Birkbeck Investment and Savings Company’s office building, in 1907. Born in Paris, Ontario in 1861, Gouinlock studied architecture in Winnipeg, and opened a firm in Toronto in 1893. He was a founding member of the Ontario Association of Architects, becoming its president in 1909. He designed a number of buildings in Toronto including the Temple Building (demolished 1970), the tallest in the British Empire when completed in 1895. He also designed buildings for the Canadian National Exhibition between 1902 and 1912. Construction of the Birkbeck Building began in 1908 and when completed it housed the Canadian Birkbeck Investment and Savings Company’s banking, loan and mortgage services and corporate offices, as well as commercial office space. The company, under varying names, owned the building until 1927, when it was purchased by the Standard Bank of Canada for $180,000. Other property owners included the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the National Trust Company. \n\nThe Ontario Heritage Centre is significant for its Beaux-Arts design with baroque influence and innovative fireproof construction using porous terracotta tiles to fireproof the steel frame. Gouinlock’s original design called for a seven-storey building, however, the top three floors were omitted during construction giving the building a squat appearance. The four-bay façade is divided into three horizontal sections by cornices; a two-storey base with horizontal masonry banding, a smooth ashlar mid-level with narrow horizontal banding and an upper level with a smooth ashlar finish. The vertical arrangement is also divided into three parts, with a wide central double bay flanked by two receding single bays. The projecting central section contains a pair of two-storey niches at the level of the base, each containing a round headed window on the second floor and a ground floor window framed by an aedicule, flanked by Corinthian columns, topped with a broken pediment. At grade level, the two outer bays contain wood frame doors with large transoms framed in carved masonry surrounds, with a round window with garland detailing above. The recessed windows above are detailed with a bracketed sill, a surround with an eared architrave and prominent projecting keystones. The mid section has recessed rectangular windows, separated by panelled pilasters in the central double bay, and projecting horizontal banding of the flanking single bays. The upper-level section has the same window placement as below with keystones and voussoirs, but it is topped with a projecting sheet metal cornice and cast stone balustrade at the roof line. \n\nUpon entering the building at the main entrance (eastern doors) there is a vestibule, then a marble clad lobby with a brass letter box, and hand-operated elevator. Other interior elements include the plaster dentil trimmed egg-and-dart mouldings, glazed wood office partitions, rows of bank vaults, original washrooms, and a paneled oval boardroom with bow window and fireplace with decorative mantel. \n\nIn 2006, original glazed ceramic tile window wells were discovered on the front of the building, which were buried, and studied as an archaeological feature.\n\nSource: Ontario Heritage Trust Property Files.\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Located on Main Street South at the south end of the community of Rockwood, the Rockwood Academy’s contextual setting is significant. Originally a rural boarding school, the presence of many trees and a rural setting is maintained despite the encroachment of the town around it. The sloping topography of the site is gently incorporated into the building. \n\nThe Rockwood Academy is significant for its association with early education in Upper Canada, Quakers, teacher William Wetherald and artist Yosef Drenters. William Wetherald (1820-1898), a Quaker from Yorkshire, England arrived in Upper Canada with his family in 1835. Having studied at the prestigious Quaker school of Ackworth in Yorkshire, he became a teacher in 1843. In 1850, Wetherald founded the Rockwood Academy according to Quaker education rules, at a time when the public school system was still developing, in Upper Canada. The three-storey stone school building was built in 1853. The school operated until 1864, under Wetherald, and accommodated up to 60 students. In 1864, Donald McCaig and Alexander McMillan purchased the school and in 1867 added two wings to accommodate a store room, gymnasium, a large classroom and extra dormitories. McCaig and McMillan operated the school until 1882, when it was closed, due to the increased acceptance of the Ontario Public School system. Prominent students of the Rockwood Academy included the Honourable A.S. Hardy (Ontario’s fourth Premier from 1896-1899), Sir Adam Beck (founder of the Province’s Hydro-Electric system) and James J. Hill (railway magnate). The building was used as a woolen mill for a few years, before being left vacant until 1900, when the Gordon family bought it, for use as a farmhouse. In 1960 Yosef Drenters (1930-1986) purchased the property and spent twenty years restoring the building, and using it as an art studio. In 1986 the Ontario Heritage Trust acquired the building from Drenter’s estate. \n\nThe Rockwood Academy is an example of Late Georgian architecture. The limestone walls are laid in random rubble with rough cut quoins. The symmetrical five-bay façade has double-hung six-over-six wood sash windows with a central door distinguished by a portico and a transom window and sidelights. The low-pitched cedar-shingle gable roof is punctuated by numerous small brick and stone chimneys. The Academy was divided into private quarters for the school master’s family, living quarters for the boarding students, and classrooms. In the main block the dining room and drawing room still exist. The owner’s bedrooms are also still in existence on the second floor, as are the student’s bedrooms, on the third floor. The south wing still contains the classroom below the student bedrooms. The west wing has never been altered and contains a carriage house, on the ground floor, with a gymnasium above. The large doors to the carriage house have wide arches and rough-cut voussoirs. \n\nMany original interior elements, such as the wide plank floor boards, door and window surrounds and plaster walls, remain. Exposed wood beams in the ceilings and random rubble walls define the gymnasium, while the drawing room has a carved wood mantle and high baseboards. The cultural collection of the property contains many early examples of Canadian furnishings dating from 1818-1885, including a library bookcase, dish dresser, cupboards, clock shelf and sofa. \n\nArchaeological excavations were carried out in 1987 yielding 1,077 artifacts. The artifacts, which date from the 1840s to the mid-20th century, include fragments of glass, earthenware, a comb, a ring, coins, a spoon, hinges and bits of boot-leather. Artifacts were also found that relate to the site’s function as a school, such as pieces of slate, inkpot fragments (one intact) and pencil ends. \n\nSource: OHT Easement Files.\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The property at 902 King Street East consists of a two-and-a-half storey brick and stucco residential building, designed during a late period of revivalism between the wars, in part a rejection of the new modernism in architecture. The house was built in the 1920s as a late addition to the residential neighbourhood on St. Clair Avenue. As a result, it is visually distinct from many of the Edwardian foursquare dwellings on the street In spite of the fact that they all share certain classical motifs.\n\nArchitecturally, the house is rectangular in plan with a medium-pitched side-gable roof. The finish is brick on a concrete foundation on the ground floor, rough stucco on the exterior of the second floor. The structure itself is most likely frame. The main façade is three bays, symmetrical disposed with a central entrance. The centre bay is distinguished by the large entrance with sidelights, above which is a large Palladian1 window, crowned by a classically proportioned gable at the roofline. The side bays have six over-six double hung sash windows arranged in groups of three on the ground floor, and in pairs on the second. Two new dormers installed in the roof during the recent renovations are properly aligned with the windows below, maintaining the balance and symmetry of the design.\n\nThe proportions, balance and symmetry of the form establish its roots in the Classical tradition, which is further developed in the restrained use of features of the Tuscan order. The shallow porch comprises a pair of Tuscan columns supporting the simple entablature that defines the first storey and supports the second. During a previous series of renovations, the entablature was altered so that it no longer carries over the span of the porch itself. The simplicity of the fascia and cornice at the roofline are also in keeping with the Tuscan order. A subtle but revealing feature is that the window sills on the brick\nground floor are rough-dressed stone, both materials suitable for the robust base and support for the lighter, more slender details of the second storey.\n\nThe north and south façades differ from one another, although each has a small Palladian window in the gable peak. The fenestration on the north side is not regular or symmetrical, but it is simple and could not be described as “eclectic” as often applies to Edwardian window design. The addition of the ground floor exterior building in the 1940s had no regard for the overall character of the building.\n\nOn the south façade, a small wing houses a solarium on the upper floor, and an enclosed porch on the ground floor. The wing is centred in the gable end wall, and matches the main block of the house in its principal details of finish and materials. ",

While the building employs many of the markers of Art Moderne, it lacks the full expression of the style in a strong horizontal emphasis and sweeping curves contributing to a streamlined aesthetic.\nThe Blue Cross Animal Hospital has a long-standing direct association with a belief that animals should receive a level of care similar to that of humans. It is indirectly associated with The Blue Cross of the United Kingdom which was founded in 1897 as the Our Dumb Friend League to promote the encouragement of kindness to animals.

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Sir Harry Oakes’ Chateau, at 2 Chateau Drive, in the Town of Kirkland Lake is situated less than a kilometre from the centre of town near Highway 66. The building terminates a small residential street which serves four other residences and is not visible from the highway. The residential neighbourhood is surrounded by former mining buildings and wooded areas. The rustic nature of the chateau’s setting on a sloping landscape is reflected in its design.\n\nSir Harry Oakes’ Chateau is associated with Sir Harry Oakes and the development of Kirkland Lake. Sir Harry Oakes was born in Sangerville, Maine in 1874 and came to Canada after traveling the world looking for locations to mine gold. In 1912 he created the Tough-Oakes Mine, drawing attention to the Kirkland Lake area for the richness of its ore. Using the profits from this venture, Oakes later developed the Lake Shore Mine after he discovered gold in 1917. Oakes’ mine was one of the main employers in Kirkland Lake, and through his philanthropy, the community built a school and skating rink. In 1919 Oakes built his first home of logs on a solid rock outcrop. After being partially destroyed by fire in 1929, it was rebuilt and enlarged to its present size. Following income tax system reforms in 1934, Sir Harry left Canada to live in the Bahamas, leaving the Chateau to be used for directors’ meetings and as a temporary residence for visiting company executives. Sir Harry was knighted in 1939 by King George VI in recognition of his philanthropic work. He was murdered at his Bahamas estate in 1943, a crime that was never solved. In 1967 the Chateau was sold to the Cochrane Nursing Homes, and the remaining contents sold. After the Nursing Home changed its location, the Chateau began to arouse public interest. The exterior was restored while the interior was modified to allow for the building to accommodate the Kirkland Lake Museum of Northern History. \n\nSir Harry Oakes’ Chateau is a mixture of Prairie and Shingle architectural styles. Built in 1930 incorporating vestiges of Sir Harry Oakes’ original log dwelling, the Chateau is two-and-a-half storeys. The massive size of the structure is hidden by low pitched, copper-clad roofs. The site slopes up to the main entrance at the south end, where a deep verandah surrounds the front rooms. The columns and the facade under the verandah are made of logs. The large, wide roofs with overhangs, and horizontality of the design, are reminiscent of the Prairie style while the cedar shingle siding is inspired by Sir Harry’s New England roots. The construction of the Chateau utilizes the original log cabin as an integral part of the frame. The basement originally contained a large six-car garage and service area. The main floor contained a reception room, kitchen, living and dining area, and billiard room. These rooms have retained their original plaster, brass ceiling fixtures, sconces, fireplaces, hardwood floors and cherry woodwork. The second floor contained the private rooms of the family including four bathrooms and a music room. One bedroom also has the added feature of plaster cartoons on the wall depicting nursery rhymes, fairy tales, and wildlife. The attic was one large playroom and had a small balcony with solid and open balustrades. Although a mezzanine was created between the second and attic storeys, an elevator added to the rear of the house, and some walls removed in the servants living quarters, the Chateau’s interior retains much of its original character. With the restoration of the exterior to the original shingle siding, the chateau’s original aesthetic has been restored. \n\nSources: OHT Property Files; Cowan, Bob Sir Harry Oakes: 1874-1943 An Accumulation of Notes.

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Located near a bend in the Sydenham River slightly southwest of the Town of Dresden, Uncle Tom’s Cabin Historic Site occupies a five-acre parcel of land within the boundaries of the original Josiah Henson farm plot. Although the Harris House has been moved a significant distance from its original location on Wilson Street in Dresden, its current contextual setting is likely to resemble that of the residential buildings within the former Black settlement of Dawn. Two other historic buildings have been relocated onto the site, the Henson House (c. 1850) and the Pioneer Church (c. 1850), and a new building, the Josiah Henson Interpretive Centre, which was constructed in 1994 to accommodate a museum and theatre. The Harris House is somewhat separated from the other buildings, but it stands in close proximity to a display of historic farm equipment and a smokehouse constructed within the trunk of a sycamore tree.\n\nThe Harris House is historically significant for its associations with the Underground Railroad and the settlement of refugee slaves in Southwestern Ontario. Reportedly built by a former slave, the house is one of the few fugitive slave structures remaining in Ontario and is representative of the type of housing common amongst the Black settlers of the Dresden area. The house was originally located within a row of architecturally similar houses on Dresden’s Wilson Street, but was moved to its current location at Uncle Tom’s Cabin Historic Site in 1964 after use as a granary on a nearby farm property. While the complete history of the building is unclear, it provides a good example of a fugitive slave’s first freedom quarters.\n\nThe Harris House is architecturally significant as an example of a vernacular building style typically associated with refugee slaves. The modest structure, which measures only 5m x 5m, is built of local materials and completely lacks the ornamentation of other buildings typical of the same era. The simple design includes a single room on the main floor used for domestic activities and a single room on the second floor to serve as the sleeping quarters. The verticality of the design is representative of the need to keep warm during the cold Canadian winters; a task often difficult for persons more accustomed to the climate of the southern American states. Building “up,” rather than “out,” facilitated the maximum usage of heat from the ground floor fireplace and the small dimensions of the house ensured the proper heating of the entire internal space. Another interesting feature of the house is the presence of only one window on each of the house’s four elevations. Unlike larger structures, four windows (two per floor) were enough to adequately light all areas of the house. In 1993, a fieldstone foundation was prepared for the Harris House and the exterior walls of the structure were restored.\n\nSource: Trust Property Files, Ontario Heritage Trust\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Located near a bend in the Sydenham River slightly southwest of the Town of Dresden, Uncle Tom’s Cabin Historic Site occupies a five-acre parcel of land within the boundaries of the original Henson farm plot. The Henson House has been moved several times since the death of Josiah Henson in 1883, but its current contextual setting near the river is likely similar to its original location. Two other historic buildings, the Pioneer Church (c. 1850) and the Harris House (c. 1890), have been moved to the site to assist with interpretive functions, and a new building, The Josiah Henson Interpretive Centre, was constructed on site in 1994 to accommodate a museum and theatre. The Henson Family Cemetery is situated directly west of the Henson House and the grave of Josiah Henson is commemorated at this location with a plaque erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. Only vestiges of the original Henson farm remain today, as the thick walnut groves that originally covered the land have long been replaced by an expanse of open farm fields.\n\nThe Henson House is historically significant for its association with Reverend Josiah Henson, a fugitive slave, memoirist, and conductor on the Underground Railroad, who rose in status to international celebrity as the inspiration for the character of Tom in Harriet Beecher Stowe’s 1852 novel, Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Born in Maryland in 1789, Henson escaped slavery in 1830 when he followed the Underground Railroad into Upper Canada with his wife Charlotte and their four children. In 1841, Henson and a group of abolitionists purchased 200 acres of land southwest of the current Town of Dresden and established the Black settlement of Dawn to accommodate newly arrived refugee slaves. In an effort to provide these refugee slaves with the education and skills they needed to become self-sufficient, Henson co-founded a vocational school called the British American Institute. With the success of the school, the Dawn settlement grew to approximately 500 residents, but its numbers began to decline in 1863 with the emancipation proclamation by US President Abraham Lincoln. Despite the option to return to his native country, Henson chose to remain in Canada and it is believed that he and his wife spent the remainder of their lives in the two-storey house that now sits within the boundaries of Uncle Tom’s Cabin Historic Site. The Henson House is also associated with the early development of heritage conservation and tourism in Ontario. The potential for converting the Henson House into a museum and promoting it as a historic attraction was first realized in 1948 by then owner, William Chapple. Chapple’s efforts to restore the modest dwelling as a museum ensured its survival at a time when the architectural conservation movement had not yet been developed in Ontario. \n\nThe Henson House is architecturally significant as an example of mid-19th century vernacular domestic architecture. The two-storey, post-and-beam structure is considered a substantial building for the standards of its day in rural Ontario. When compared to the homes typically associated with fugitive slaves, it stands as a visible symbol of the status and power accumulated by Henson during the latter years of his life. The house is constructed from local materials and exhibits the proportions and central hall plan common amongst many of the province’s earliest residential structures. Its date of construction has been an issue of debate for many years, and calculations made by qualified historians and architects have ranged from the early-1840s to the mid-1870s. Despite the absence of conclusive evidence, most recent efforts to date the building have resulted in an estimation of c. 1850.\n\nSource: Trust Property Files, Ontario Heritage Trust\n",

A new building, the Josiah Henson Interpretive Centre, was constructed in 1994 to accommodate a museum and theatre. The Henson Family Cemetery is situated directly north of the Pioneer Church and the grave of Josiah Henson is commemorated at this location with a plaque erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. The combined church and cemetery grounds serve as a reminder of the spiritual significance of the site.\n\nThe Pioneer Church is historically significant as a visual representation of the types of churches in which Reverend Henson preached while residing at the Dawn settlement. The role of the church was central to the residents of Dawn, as it not only served the spiritual needs of its members, but also assisted in the social, recreational, and educational development of the locals. In fact, the role of religion was often exaggerated in Black settlement areas, where refugee slaves used religion as a form of spiritual escapism to overcome the oppression of their former lives. In the early 1960s, as part of a plan to expand the tourist potential of Uncle Tom’s Cabin Historic Site, the site’s museums committee set out to commemorate the role of religion in Henson’s life. Since the Methodist Church in Dresden (the church that Henson was most closely associated with) had been destroyed by fire early in the 20th century, the museums committee began a search for a small wooden chapel that was similar in size, design, and date to the Dresden church. Eventually, a small wood frame church that satisfied the search criteria was located near the Town of Wheatley, approximately 70 km southwest of the site. This church, known as the Pioneer Church, was built c. 1850 and had a history of use as both a Presbyterian and Anglican Church during the second half of the 19th century. It was moved to Uncle Tom’s Cabin Historic Site in 1964.\n\nThe Pioneer Church is architecturally significant as a handsome example of a one-room church in the Carpenter’s Gothic style. Once a common architectural form in Ontario, this type of church is usually associated with small rural settlements and has become increasingly rare in Ontario. The single-storey church boasts board and batten cladding, contains a modest entrance at its eastern gable end and displays axial symmetry in each of its elevations. The six windows of the building are divided equally between the north, east, and south elevations, and it is their lancet-shaped openings that give the church its typically Gothic appearance. The interior of the church consists of a single room with ten pews divided into two rows, wainscoting along each wall, and a raised speaker’s platform at the west end. The oak pulpit and organ that sit upon this platform are of special significance, as they both originate from the Methodist Church in Dresden where Reverend Henson preached many of his famous sermons.\n\nSource: Trust Property Files, Ontario Heritage Trust\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The W. Ross Macdonald School is provincially significant because of its historical associations and design value. It was the first provincial school for the blind in Ontario, and illustrates the province’s ongoing commitment to the education of the blind. Buildings at the site illustrate the design work of the Ontario Department of Public Works under Provincial Architects Kivas Tully and Francis Heakes. The site is also associated with nationally significant landscape architect Heinrich Engelhardt, and provincially significant school principal A.H. Dymond. W. Ross Macdonald School for the Blind was established by the Province of Ontario in 1872 as part of a post-Confederation initiative to provide government schools to educate the blind, deaf and dumb. Called the Ontario Institution for the Education and Instruction of the Blind (OIEIB), it was unique in Ontario, and one of only three schools for the blind across Canada. It provided a public school education for children aged seven to twenty-one, and manual and vocational training to ensure their productivity and independence. The school later expanded to add secondary school (1935), deaf-blind (1971), and day programs. It was renamed the Ontario School for the Blind (OSB) in 1913 and W. Ross Macdonald School for the Blind in 1974, honoring the current \nLieutenant-Governor. Today, after almost 140 years, the school continues to operate as the only English-language, provincial facility providing education for blind, deaf-blind and visually-impaired children. Built resources at the site reflect the evolution of the program and the province’s ongoing commitment to the operation of a high-quality school for the blind. \n\nFOR FULL STATEMENT OF CULTURAL HERITAGE VALUE SEE ATTACHMENTS.\n",

The subject property is located on Lot 30, Concession 3 in the Geographic Township of Essa, Simcoe County. The property contains 24 purpose-built buildings dating from 1925 to 2005 that were used to support extraction of conifer seeds which were supplied to provincial nurseries until 1996 for the purpose of growing seedlings to assist with reforesting Ontario. The OTSP was established in 1923.\nSoon after the addition of a large modern warehouse for receiving and drying cone shipments in 1989, the public sector in the province of Ontario was directed to restructure government services to focus on defined core businesses. The 10 provincial nurseries were closed in 1998 and 1999. Despite being extensively audited in both 1991 and 1993, the OTSP continued operations. A Business Case for Alternate Service Delivery was developed in 1997, followed in 1999 with a Business Plan which proposed five options, including either leasing or selling to the private sector. The consideration of privatization of the OTSP led Millson Forest Service in Timmins to invest in equipment to provide seed extraction and processing services in 1999. Some of the recommendations in the OTSP Business Plan were focused on adopting business-like approaches (e.g., expanding the client base by developing partnerships) which presented challenges for a public sector organization and had the potential to lead to perceived competition with private industry seed extraction services. Ultimately, due to declining seed orders and significant operating costs, the government closed the OTSP in September 2018.",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "141 King Street property was the second location in Ontario where tree seeds were extracted. Seed extraction began in Ontario at the St. Williams Forest Station established in 1908. The original buildings where extraction took place in St. Williams (3-Bay Garage, former lunchroom) are still on the property. Prior to World War I there was only this one Provincial Forest Station in Ontario, and it was adequate to meet the demand for seed collection and processing (Carman 1951). However, with the scale of reforestation program planned in the 1920s, St. Williams Forest Station’s capacity was inadequate and hence the Ontario Tree Seed Plant was established in 1923 in Angus, Ontario.\nThe Angus location was chosen as it was the most central point for the Southern Ontario Reforestation program that resulted in development of the County, and later Agreement Forests. Between 1923 and sometime in the 1950s both St. Williams and Angus produced conifer seeds for Ontario reforestation efforts (Bacher 2011 p. 124; pers. comm. Dolf Wynia, former Superintendent St. Williams Forest Station, 2019), but the volumes of seed extracted by the OTSP were substantially higher. Up until its closure in 1999, St Williams continued to process hardwood seed, focusing specifically on local, native Carolinian species (pers. comm. Ron Thayer, former staff St. Williams Forest Station, 2019). After 1954, tree planting expanded to Crown Land in the province. Cone collection was decentralized to the 22 Lands & Forests Department Districts and the number of cones shipped to Angus increased substantially. Subsequently, five additional tree nurseries were established in northern Ontario, and in 1976, MNR also operated a Tree Seed Plant at the Dryden nursery to address the high cost of shipping cones from northwestern Ontario to Angus. This plant was privatized in the late 1990s.\nAlthough the 141 King Street property is associated with many conifer forests throughout the province as the planted trees were grown from seed extracted at the OTSP, these stands are also associated with the 10 provincial government nurseries where the seedlings were grown, and the Lands and Forests Department, and later MNR, employees that planted the trees and subsequently tended and thinned the plantations to develop into new, mature forests.\nThe OTSP’s role was initially limited to providing high quality seed to the five original Provincial nurseries so that their staff could then cost-effectively grow tree seedlings, with optimal irrigation and fertilization inputs, to a size large enough to ship and plant out into harsh field conditions. Depending on tree species, seedlings were generally grown in nursery beds for up to three years. Hence, the cultural heritage value of the OTSP property should be evaluated together with that of the five original Provincial nurseries that were integral to successfully reforesting the “wastelands”.\nSome of the OTSP buildings (e.g., former staff residences, current shipping office, etc.) are similar to buildings at the five original Provincial Forest Stations/nurseries (i.e., St. Williams, Orono, Midhurst, Sandbanks and Kemptville). In fact, Superintendent residences, offices, garages, and sheds at all these properties were built to standard architectural plans (e.g., Three-Bay Garage at St. Williams is similar to both the Heated and Unheated Three-Bay Garages at 141 King Street, B15054 and B15056, respectively).\nAs was typical of many Department of Lands and Forests operations of the time, the landscape around the OTSP was beautified and accessible to the public. The Forest Stations developed plantations and woodlands as demonstration areas where the benefits of tree planting and good forestry practices could be shown to landowners and the public. Additionally, the Forest Stations also included picnic areas, trout ponds, interpretive centres, and trails.",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The Bathurst Street Bridge is of cultural heritage value or interest for its historical, design and contextual values.\n\nHistorical Values\nThe Bathurst Street Bridge is associated with historical themes at the local and provincial levels. The relocated, rebuilt and realigned bridge is closely associated the City of Toronto’s efforts, spearheaded by the Public Works Department and the Toronto Harbour Commission, to improve rail and water transportation along the reclaimed shoreline. This was necessary to support Toronto’s increasingly important manufacturing industries located north of the rail lines. The city also recognized that public amenities such as the Canadian National Exhibition\n(CNE) were important to the maturing city and made specific efforts to provide access to them.\n\nAt a provincial level, the Bathurst Street Bridge is closely associated with the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) from the early 20th century until its bankruptcy in 1919. The bridge’s original construction in 1903 is associated with a period in GTR history characterized by aggressive upgrading and renewal of its stations and rail infrastructure in order to remain competitive. The substantial investment made to its tracks and bridges was reflected in the robust, original construction of the Bathurst Street Bridge. The double track bridge was intended to increase haulage capacity by accommodating heavier engines and heavier payloads. Its relocation, rebuilding and widening for use as a four lane city bridge carrying vehicular and streetcar traffic is further evidence of its robust construction.\n\nDesign Values\nThe Bathurst Street Bridge demonstrates design values at the local and provincial levels. The Bathurst Street Bridge is a representative example of riveted, through truss, Warren bridge. Although the Warren truss was used with mixed results in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the advent of riveted steel construction saw an increase in the use of the Warren trusses. In its original 1903 construction and 1916 reconstruction, the bridge demonstrates a high degree of craftsmanship and standard of accuracy – evidenced by its good condition after nearly a century of use. The use of large scale steel in a Warren truss design represents a high degree of technical achievement for 1903.\n\nAt a provincial level, the bridge’s 1916 reconstruction with provision for future re-alignment, and subsequent rotation in 1931 about a fixed pier also represent significant technical achievements for the period.\n\nContextual Values\nThe Bathurst Street Bridge has contextual values at the local level. Evidence of the bridge’s robust railway construction maintains the transportation character of\nthe area as GO Transit, VIA Rail and UP Express all pass beneath the bridge. Spanning the USRC, the bridge provides a link between the lake and areas to the north which would\notherwise be cut off by the railway tracks. The Bathurst Street Bridge has served in this capacity for nearly 100 years, replacing older bridges dating to the 1880s. With its impressive span, robust top & bottom chords and fine trellised upper bracing the bridge is highly visible\nfrom the east, north, and south. The bridge is well-known to Torontonians – pedestrians, cyclists, public transit users and drivers – who use it daily.",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The provincial heritage value of the Humber River Bridge at Weston Road lies in its design value as an enduring example of the Grand Trunk Railway’s engineering techniques, its historical associations with a provincially significant railway line, and (to a limited degree) its contextual value as a prominent structure within the surrounding landscape.\n\nDating to 1855, the Humber River Bridge is an early example of a railway bridge in Ontario, constructed only three years after the Grand Trunk Railway Company (GTR) was incorporated. Its design, particularly the double track abutments that were built to accommodate future expansion, is a particularly intact and distinctive example of the GTR’s practices and high technical standards, although this feature is not significant enough to be a heritage attribute. The bridge’s most unusual feature is its brick construction, which was rarely used for engineering works at the time. Beyond its use of brick rather than stone, it is aesthetically representative of the bridges constructed as part of the GTR. It also displays evidence of the processes of gunite repairs to the brick in c.1921 and 1932, and its current state reflects the achievement of those repairs. Following the GTR’s early, experimental use\nof gunite on this bridge, gunite repair became a standard procedure for railway restoration. Although recent modifications to widen the bridge have affected its silhouette and north elevation, and have involved removal of original trusswork, the bridge’s abutments and concrete-encased brick piers remain intact and legibly distinct from the new additions. Rather than detracting from the bridge’s significance, the new additions are in keeping with the original notion that the bridge would ultimately be expanded.\n\nThis bridge was constructed to carry a portion of the Grand Trunk Railway’s main line between Montreal, Toronto, and Guelph. The Grand Trunk played an important role in Ontario’s development history, as the Grand Trunk rail network expanded steadily with financing from England and ultimately connected the province with Quebec and the northeast United States. The construction of the bridge\nwas guided by three prominent Canadian engineers: Walter Shanly as chief engineer, Francis Shanly as resident engineer, and Casimir Gzowski as contractor.\n\nThe bridge was a landmark at the time it was built, due to its distinctive brick piers and double-width abutments, and its prominent location within a steep portion of the Humber Valley. Because of its early construction, the bridge has a well-established presence within the area. The landscape surrounding the bridge was obtained by the Weston Golf and Country Club, which opened in 1914. Within the private\nlandscape of the club, increasingly restricted access for nearly a century has significantly diminished the bridge’s contextual value as a landmark. However, it remains linked to its surroundings as it continues to carry rail across the Humber River and Humber Valley.\n",

This was a significant improvement to railway infrastructure in southern Ontario that contributed to economic and population growth,\nparticularly in the Greater Toronto Area.\n\nThe Credit River Bridge is an unusual and unique example of an inverted bowstring arch deck truss bridge and is thought to be one-of-a-kind in Ontario. The low curved chord underneath the bridge gives a sense of floating above the water as it extends over the Credit River, for an unsupported 210 ft (63m). The unique design, combined with the span of the deck truss, demonstrates that the Credit River Bridge has a high degree of technical achievement. Distinctive features of this style of bridge construction include: combination of pin and riveted connections; heavy duty steel ten panel truss with diagonal members forming a Warren truss configuration; lower curved chord composed of lighter, less robust, steel; and massive eyebar bundles.\n\nThe Credit River Bridge was designed by Chief Engineer of the GTR, Joseph Hobson, and fabricated by the Canadian Bridge Company Limited of Walkerville, in 1903.

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The Little Current Swing Bridge is associated with the development of railways in northern Ontario and was constructed as part of the Algoma Eastern Railway. Railway connection between northern and southern Ontario was seen as an important factor in the development of mining, pulp and paper, and timber industries in the north that needed access to markets in the southwest of the province. Planning for the Algoma Eastern Railway began as early as the 1880s as a way of connecting Manitoulin Island to the mainland and the erection of a swing bridge across the North Channel at Little Current would allow shipping traffic use of the channel while trains were not crossing the bridge. Passenger service was also part of the operation providing residents of the island with a permanent link to the mainland and eventually supporting tourism on Manitoulin Island that developed into a significant industry by the 1920s. While the plan was to connect Sudbury with southern Ontario, the railway never reached further south than Little Current. Passenger service ceased in 1963 with all rail service ending in the 1980s. The bridge is the only surviving remnant of the Algoma Eastern Railway line between Little Current and Espanola and serves as a visible reminder of the importance that was given to railway and resource development in the early 20th century.\n\nThe Little Current Swing Bridge is significant as a rare surviving example of a moveable swing bridge. It is the longest known example of a swing bridge in Ontario. The use of swing bridge designs was most prominent between 1890 and 1910. As these types of bridges often require complex systems for allowing their movement, they were used only in specific situations, typically where road or rail traffic needed to pass over a watercourse without inhibiting marine traffic. At the time of its construction, the Little Current Swing Bridge represented the height of engineering technology in movable swing bridge types.\n\nThe superstructure consists of a two-span riveted steel through truss swing section and three riveted steel deck plate fixed approach spans. The control room is located above the centre of the bridge and accessed via a metal staircase on the east side of the bridge. To facilitate the passage of ships, the superstructure is built atop a central pier in the watercourse upon which the bridge pivots. The pivot motion allows the bridge to swing horizontally at 90 degrees, allowing marine traffic to pass through the open channel created on either side of the central pier. A pedestrian walkway on the west side of the bridge consists of wood decking and a steel railing that is supported from the bridge stringer.\n\nThe substructure of the bridge consists of the abutments, wingwalls, piers, and machinery associated with the swing bridge. The bridge has six cast-in-place concrete piers some of which contain machinery and mechanisms associated with the bridge’s swinging operation. The two piers, located approximately 50 metres to the east and west of the bridge, support the bridge when it is swung into the open position. The centre pier contains the ring gear, balancing trucks, the centre pivot bearing, and four wedges and is protected from ice and ship collisions by protection cribs. The ring gear mechanism turns on a pivot using disks and eight wheels running on steel track. The bridge is locked into place by a system of wedges. Most swing bridge designs consist of two central wedges but the Little Current Swing Bridge employs four. The use of additional wedges is attributed to the substantial size of the structure when compared to other swing bridges.\n\nNote: A full copy of the SCHV is attached  (see Attachments tab). \n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The structure, constructed c. 1905, is historically associated with the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR). CNoR constructed the railway through the East Don River valley c. 1905 as part of its transcontinental rail entrance into downtown Toronto. The CNoR had little choice in the route the new railway would follow due to the growth of the City of Toronto, the location of the Lake Ontario shoreline as well as the previously built railways. The CNoR was forced to follow the East Don River Valley to enter Toronto. The CNoR tracks entered the East Don Valley northwest of the M. 8.60 bridge, east of the intersection of Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue East. \n\nThe structure was designed to carry a single track over the Don River, and continues in this function. As designed, the structure consisted of a plate-girder deck span with two, short deck-girder timber approach spans on timber bents. The main span is supported on two concrete piers and the approach spans terminate on perched concrete abutments.\n\nThe M. 8.60 Bridge, which survives relatively intact, is a representative example of a steel plate girder bridge structure. The bridge, including the approaches, piers and abutments, and other structural elements was constructed of concrete, timber and steel. All of these were widely-used construction materials for railway structures in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Despite the introduction of\nstructures built entirely of concrete, steel girders were used well into the 20th century and can be found as part of modern railway structures today. The steel for the M. 8.60 Bridge was fabricated and erected by the Hamilton Bridge Works Co. Ltd., a well-known steel fabricator and bridge manufacturer in southern Ontario.",

The substructure of the bridge, however, dates to the original 1892 construction of the CPR Don Branch and is a good representative example of a surviving stone masonry substructure in the local context. While once common, stone masonry substructures are becoming increasingly rare as they are replaced with cast-in-place concrete examples that meet modern design and safety codes. Further, the 1892 stone masonry piers and abutments are considered to be an early example of stone masonry substructure construction in the local context based on a review of comparative bridges.\nThe Don River Bridge is significant for having physical/design value as an early and representative example of stone masonry bridge substructure design and construction in a railway context in the City of Toronto.\n\nThe Don River Bridge is significant for having historical/associative value as has direct historical associations with the CPR Don Branch rail corridor, the first rail line that was allowed to access the downtown core of Toronto and Toronto Harbour from the north through the Don Valley. The CPR Don Branch significantly contributed to the nineteenth-century commercial and industrial growth and development of the City of Toronto, and the stone masonry abutments and piers, built in 1892, are original constructions on this significant rail line.\n\nThe Don River Bridge is significant for having contextual value as it physically and functionally supports the use of the CPR Don Branch rail corridor as a crossing of the Don River.

The removal of the CNR cross-town tracks through the city, which freed up land for scenic driveways, government buildings and the construction of the Queensway was a critical aspect of the proposed development of Canada’s National Capital Region as presented in the Gréber Plan.\n\nThe Rideau River (Hurdman’s) Bridges formed the eastern entrance to the cross-town Queensway and a new link in the Trans-Canada Highway. The Rideau River Bridges were the first structures completed on the new highway in 1955 and formed an important crossing over the Rideau River. With the bridge over the Rideau Canal, the Rideau River Bridges were considered to be the major structures within the corridor. Commemorative plaques placed on the Rideau River (Hurdman’s) Bridges at the time of their official openings attest to the symbolic value of the structures. Furthermore, the bridges were dedicated in October 2009 to the memory of Provincial Constable J. Robert Maki.

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The bridge is associated with the relocation of Highway 7 and the flood control plans of the Wildwood Conservation Area. The highway was constructed on an entirely new right-of-way on top of the Wildwood Dam.\n\nThe length of bridge was determined by the width of the control structure in the dam. In order to operate, the dam required four sluice gates, each 12 feet wide, with their combined width being approximately 63 feet. The deck is supported by eight pre-stressed concrete girders. The girders rest on seats formed in the walls of the spillway channel. A control building has been constructed on the north side of the bridge and it is protected from the traffic on Highway 7 by a concrete barrier.\n\nThe bridge itself is structurally independent of the control building and the gate lifting platforms. Sidewalks were built on each side of the bridge, a rather unusual feature for rural highway bridges of the time. The Wildwood Dam Bridge, though not uncommon in design, is an early example of pre-stressed concrete girder design and is the only combined highway bridge and dam structure in the west region. The combined dam and bridge over the spillway is a landmark in the Wildwood Conservation Area on Highway 7. \n\nDue to construction of an entirely new road on top of the dam, M.M. Dillon and Company, consulting engineer firm for the Wildwood Dam scheme, had to work closely with the then Ontario Department of Highways during the design process. In particular, the location of the longitudinal axis of the dam was dictated by the need to fit the new alignment of the highway.\n\nSource: Cultural Heritage Evaluation Report (CHER) – Wildwood Dam Bridge (MTO Site #25-268) – Highway 7, Perth County, Ontario (December 2009) prepared by Golder Associates Ltd.\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The Wahnapitae Power Company under the partnership of Frank Cochrane and William McVittie developed the Coniston GS to provide electrical power to the Sudbury area. The company was incorporated in 1902; the construction of Coniston GS was commenced in 1904 and the first unit was place in service in 1905. Additional units were added in 1907\nand 1915. The Coniston GS was the first of three interconnected generating stations constructed by the Wahnapitae Power Company on the Wanapitei River. The reliable power produced by the Coniston GS contributed to the economic growth of Sudbury as well as the mining industry of the Sudbury Basin. Frank Cochrane and William McVittie are both noted business pioneers in Sudbury and are recognized for their contributions as builders of the Sudbury District. Cochrane went on to become a well-known and successful politician who served as the mayor of Sudbury and as a cabinet minister at both the provincial and federal levels. The Wahnapitae Power Company retained its connection with the Cochrane and McVittie families until the HEPC, later Ontario Hydro and now OPG, acquired the company in 1929-1930.\nConiston GS is an early example of a hydroelectric generating station from the first part of the 20th century. Dating to 1905, it is one of the oldest stations remaining in operation in the province, the third oldest station within OPG’s portfolio and the oldest facility in operation on the Wanapitei River. In terms of materials, Coniston GS is a rare example of a generating station exhibiting stone construction for important components of the facility, rather than the more typical concrete. The layout of the plant followed standard engineering technology and its design was well executed as its continued use attests. The Coniston GS retains significant components of its original equipment including three horizontal Francis style turbines and three alternating current generators that would be\nconsidered obsolete by today’s standards. The plant has been modified over the years to maintain operations but it retains significant elements of its design character and key components.\nThe Coniston GS comprising main dam and sluiceways, inlet, forebay canal, headworks, penstocks, powerhouse, tailrace and transformer house clearly conveys its function and age as a hydroelectric complex dating to the early 20th century. It remains in active use and as the oldest station on the waterway and one of the oldest in the Sudbury area the facility is a tangible asset that makes an important contribution to the understanding of the history of hydroelectric generation and the mining industry in the region. The plant retains its traditional relationship with Sudbury as well as the community of Coniston. Its proximity and accessibility to Sudbury heightens its interpretive potential.",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The Norris Whitney Bridge is noteworthy as a rare example of a long-span high-level bridge that uses weathering steel I-beam girders. At 896 metres (2940 feet) long, it is the longest weathering steel plate I-beam girder bridge owned by the Ministry of Transportation (MTO). It consists of 11 spans compromised of two 58 metre (190 feet) spans at each end and nine 85 metre (279 feet) spans and rises approximately 75 metres (246 feet) above the Bay of Quinte at its apex. The reinforced concrete deck sits on weathered steel plate girders, which rest on steel bearings on the top of piers. Four large weathering steel girders support the width of the bridge and are interconnected by steel cross braces. The piers are made of two rectangular concrete pier columns with a rectangular pier cap and are supported on concrete footings.\n\nThe bridge is named after Norris Whitney, local M.P.P and long serving politician for the area, who had been an early advocate for the bridge. The original crossing was a, 11 span truss bridge with main through truss swing span that was built in 1891 and at the time was the longest bridge in the Province of Ontario. The single lane bridge was replaced in stages between 1927-1931 with a new 2-span and 5-span steel truss spans, the latter containing a new swing bridge, and rock causeways between them. By the 1970s, the swing bridge created traffic bottlenecks during the summer boating season and had become outdated and in need of regular repair. A high-level bridge was proposed since it would allow vehicular traffic to cross the bridge without inhibiting marine traffic in the Bay of Quinte.\n\nThe bridge was built between 1980-1982 to designs by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (now MTO). The steel spans of the bridge were fabricated and erected by the Dominion Bridge Company, a very prominent steel firm in the 20th century.\n\nThe bridge is a highly visible landmark in the area and serves as a connection between Prince Edward County and Hastings County. It is well-proportioned and has a general massing that is appropriate to its surroundings. Its physical prominence provides distinctive views of the bridge from the City of Belleville and the north shores of Ameliasburgh Township and Massassauga Point as well as panoramic views from the bridge deck of the Bay of Quinte to the east and west.\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "Sited in the community of Williamstown, the Bethune-Thompson House borders the Raisin River. Williamstown has maintained many of its 19th century homes and the Bethune-Thompson House is in close proximity to other museums including the Nor’wester and Loyalist Museum and Sir John Johnson Manor. The site itself, in addition to the main house includes an extant drive shed and the 1840s workers’ cottage, which was purchased by Murdoch in 1871.\n\nThe property on which the Bethune-Thompson House is located was originally granted to Peter Ferguson in 1784, a Scottish immigrant to the American Colonies who served in the King’s Royal Regiment of New York. As a Loyalist settler to Charlottenburgh Township he settled on the west half of Lot 50, Concession 1 and built a log house. In 1804, Loyalist settler Rev. John Bethune (1751-1815) purchased the land from Ferguson and built a house, to which he later moved and attached the Ferguson log cabin to form a side wing of his house. Bethune was founder of St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church in Williamstown and was the first Presbyterian minister in Upper Canada. He also founded congregations and preached at Cornwall, Lancaster, and Martintown. In 1815, just weeks after the death of Rev. Bethune, his wife Véronique (Wadden) Bethune, sold the house to David Thompson (1770-1857). Thompson, a retired North West Company partner mapped much of western Canada. He also worked for the Boundary Commission, mapping out the border between British North America and the United States. The Thompson family lived in the home from 1815 to about 1836, when the family incurred financial difficulties and left for Montreal. \n\nThe property was sold to Farquar McLennan and his descendants lived in the house until 1937. In 1937, William Smart, the McLennan’s farm manager, purchased the home and Mae Smart (daughter-in-law to William) sold the property to the Ontario Heritage Trust in 1977 to ensure the preservation of the property. The house underwent a major restoration in the mid 1980s.\n\nThe one-and-a-half storey Bethune-Thompson House displays early French Canadian building techniques used in its construction. The 1784 log house was added to Bethune’s new home and was used as a kitchen, where a large stone hearth remains. The walls of the log cabin were constructed using a French Canadian method called “poteaux sur sole.” Logs in vertical positions were held together by horizontal plates located at the top and bottom. In the 1804 construction of his home (used as a manse) Bethune used other French Canadian construction methods, “colombage pierrotté”, a system of post and beams made from heavy timber which are filled in with stone, bricks or sticks and mud, and the use of “tôle à la canadienne” roofing, creating a diamond pattern using tin. The walls of the house were then covered with pebble dash and painted white. The symmetrical wings and front central pediment give the home a Neoclassical look, and Thompson’s later improvements such as the verandah add a Regency flavour. The interior contains two examples of hand printed wallpaper put up by Bethune which have survived due to the installation of false walls by Thompson. A significant amount of the Georgian woodwork survives, and can be seen in the front door, staircase, and parlour mantel. The layout of the centre block has the rooms arranged in a ‘U’ shape around an entrance and stair hall. The house also has symmetrical side wings, the 1784 log house and a 1914 north wing damaged by fire in the 1930s. \n\nArchaeological excavations were conducted at Bethune-Thompson House in 1980, 1981 and 1993 and uncovered more then 36,000 artifacts. A number of mixing bowls, a pharmaceutical jar which dates from 1730-1830, a plate rim with a feather-edge decorative motif, attributed to the Wedgwood Factory, were all some of the items found on the property.\n\nSource: Ontario Heritage Trust Property Files\n",

The Niagara Parkway is a scenic boulevard along the shore of the Niagara River between Niagara-on-the-Lake and Fort Erie.  The property is described as part of Lots 12, 13, and 14, Concession 5, and part of Lot 9, 1st Cross Concession.  The 19-hectare area is composed of three areas:  the Niagara Parks Marina; the shoreline approximately 330 m north and 430 m south of the marina; and an 18-hectare open space west of the Niagara River Parkway.  The marina sits on a square parcel of land projecting into the river.  It features a concrete-block building, marine station, gas pump, water, and pump out services.  A central grassed area is surrounded by a paved parking strip, which is bordered by more grass along the marina’s edges.  Docks with 135 boat slips are located along the northwest and southeast sides of the marina.  There is limited passive recreational space along the adjacent Niagara Parks Commission shoreline.  The open space contained by Cairn’s Crescent and the Niagara River Parkway is primarily vacant.",
        "Statement of Cultural Heritage Value or Interest:": "The heritage attributes essential to the cultural heritage value of the property are:\n\n-attributes related to its historical associations, including:\n-remaining evidence of the shipyard including the\nsquare man-made peninsula, with adjacent boat slips\n\n-attributes relating to its contextual values, including:\n-its location on the Niagara Parkway on the upper Niagara River\n-views of the Niagara River and the United States as a backdrop\n",
        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The Niagara Parks Marina is of cultural heritage value or interest for its historical and associative values.  The property has direct association with the theme of Great Lakes shipbuilding, having supported two different shipbuilding operations between 1903-1909, and again from 1918-1920.  The site on the upper Niagara River was selected by the Canadian Shipbuilding Company to facilitate construction of vessels larger than the locks at the Welland Canal.  Having completed construction of the shipyard in 1906, the company went on to produce the laker E. B. Osler in 1908.  At 150 meters (490 feet), the E. B. Osler was considerably longer than the 82 metre (270 foot) locks of the Welland Canal.  The demand for ships during the First World War led to the Canadian Allis-Chalmers Company re-establishing a shipyard on the site in 1918, constructing four ships over the next two years:  War Magic in 1919 and then War Vixen, War Wallaby/North American and War Wombat/South American in 1920.  The shipyard was closed and dismantled following the fulfillment of these contracts.  The property is associated with the Underground Railway as many former slaves worked in the shipyards and lived nearby in the community known as Little Africa.  Historically the property is associated with the Miller family who owned and farmed the land from 1801-1903.  Pre-contact Indigenous and historical Euro-Canadian archaeological artifacts were found in three locations at the Marina site through a Stage 3 archaeological assessment.  The pre-contact Indigenous artifacts, which likely represent a campsite, add to the body of knowledge related to Indigenous land use in the Niagara area.  The Euro-Canadian artifacts relate to the 19th century occupation by the Miller family, and add to knowledge of early European settlement and land use patterns in Niagara.",

Identified by the mixture of elements drawn from English medieval architecture, its design is particularly distinguished by the asymmetrical plan with projecting horizontal and vertical planes, the fenestration that includes an oriel window typical of Period Revival styling, and the application of corbelled brickwork and clinker bricks. The \nappearance of the Mary Reid House is reminiscent of the houses designed for nearby Kingsway Park (south of St. George's Golf and Country Club) and the other 20th century residential enclaves developed by the R. Home Smith Company along the Humber River, all of which featured architecture \nand landscaping inspired by the English Garden City Movement.\n\nThe property at 4200 Eglinton Avenue West also has cultural heritage value related to its contextual importance in maintaining and supporting the historical character of the area as it developed at the corner of Eglinton Avenue West and Royal York Road. Originally associated with the farming \ncommunity of Richview, the land adjoining this intersection (northwest) was divided in the early 20th century as a small residential enclave characterized by large lot sizes. While the remainder of the subdivision did not develop as envisioned, with its scale, landscaped setting, and setback on a comer lot, the Mary Reid House is a reminder of the intended appearance of this part of Etobicoke.\n\nContextually, the Mary Reid House is also valued for its links to its setting on the north side of Eglinton Avenue West, west of Royal York Road where it is placed in and viewed across open space, set back from the thoroughfare, accessed via a semicircular driveway and separated from the street by a low stone wall with stone gate posts.",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The property at 902 King Street East consists of a two-and-a-half storey brick and stucco residential building, designed during a late period of revivalism between the wars, in part a rejection of the new modernism in architecture. The house was built in the 1920s as a late addition to the residential neighbourhood on St. Clair Avenue. As a result, it is visually distinct from many of the Edwardian foursquare dwellings on the street In spite of the fact that they all share certain classical motifs.\n\nArchitecturally, the house is rectangular in plan with a medium-pitched side-gable roof. The finish is brick\non a concrete foundation on the ground floor, rough stucco on the exterior of the second floor. The structure itself is most likely frame. The main façade is three bays, symmetrical disposed with a central entrance. The centre bay is distinguished by the large entrance with sidelights, above which is a large Palladian window, crowned by a classically proportioned gable at the roofline. The side bays have six-over-six double hung sash windows arranged in groups of three on the ground floor, and in pairs on the\nsecond. Two new dormers installed in the roof during the recent renovations are properly aligned with the windows below, maintaining the balance and symmetry of the design.\n\nThe proportions, balance and symmetry of the form establish its roots in the Classical tradition, which is further developed in the restrained use of features of the Tuscan order. The shallow porch comprises a pair of Tuscan columns supporting the simple entablature that defines the first storey and supports the second. During a previous series of renovations, the entablature was altered so that it no longer carries over the span of the porch itself. The simplicity of the fascia and cornice at the roofline are also in keeping with the Tuscan order. A subtle but revealing feature is that the window sills on the brick ground floor are rough-dressed stone, both materials suitable for the robust base and support for the lighter,\nmore slender details of the second storey.\n\nThe north and south façades differ from one another, although each has a small Palladian window in the\ngable peak. The fenestration on the north side is not regular or symmetrical, but it is simple and could not be described as “eclectic” as often applies to Edwardian window design. The addition of the ground floor exterior building in the 1940s had no regard for the overall character of the building.\n\nOn the south façade, a small wing houses a solarium on the upper floor, and an enclosed porch on the ground floor. The wing is centred in the gable end wall, and matches the main block of the house in its principal details of finish and materials.\n",

        "Statement of Cultural Heritage Value or Interest:": "Heritage Attributes that contribute to the property’s cultural heritage value as a representative example of a rural Euro-Canadian cemetery include: \n\n• Original markers and monuments with their surviving inscriptions and hand-carved motifs\n• Granite cairn containing the 1902 cornerstone of the Shiloh Primitive Methodist Church and commemorating the early settler families who are interred at the cemetery\n• Landscaping elements including manicured lawn, garden beds, thicket of lilacs along its western boundary, and shrubs\n• Archaeological potential including all burials and as the site of the former Shiloh Primitive Methodist Church and associated carriage sheds\n• Location within the former hamlet of Tormore and its proximity to the former post office (10951 Highway 50)\n• Association with the historic settlement and development of Tormore and as one of the last remaining vestiges of the former hamlet",
        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The cemetery is situated in the former hamlet of Tormore, previously known as Hartville or Hart’s Corners, which was located at the edge of Toronto Gore Township and Vaughan Township. The property is associated with the early \nsettlement of Tormore and its development through the 19th and early 20th century. Many individuals who played a significant role in the development of Tormore are buried in this cemetery, including some of its first settlers. While most headstones have been removed, a granite cairn installed in 1994 attributes the names of various settler families to the cemetery. The property was also the site of the former Primitive Methodist Church (ca. 1840) that was built to serve the early settlers of Tormore until it was demolished in 1902.\n\nThe Shiloh Cemetery is a good example of 19th century cemetery design. Established in the mid-19th century, it exhibits features of rural Euro-Canadian cemeteries including its natural setting and use of markers and monuments to perpetuate the memory of individuals. The grave markers are representative of Ontario’s historical Euro-Canadian cemetery and funerary practices of the 19th\ncentury. The extant markers are all constructed of marble and feature hand-carved inscriptions and motifs commonly featured on 19th century grave markers including the weeping willow, urns, budding plants and flowers, shaking hands and the dove. The cemetery also includes an eight-foot obelisk constructed of white granite to \nhonour the deceased members of the Hart Family, a prominent family within the community. While only 10 markers remain along with the obelisk, the cemetery is thought to contain at least 100 interments.\n\nThe Shiloh Cemetery yields information about the former village of Tormore as it provides insights into the lives of the pioneer settlers who founded the community. The property also has archaeological potential encompassing all burial sites and as the location of the former Shiloh Primitive Methodist Church and associated carriage sheds.\n\nThe Shiloh Cemetery is situated directly across from the 10951 Highway 50. The property belonged to the Shuttleworth family and the extant 19th century frame house once functioned as the post office for Tomore. Members of the Shuttleworth family are buried at Shiloh Cemetery. The cemetery and the former post office are all that remain of the former hamlet of Tormore.\n\n",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The design or physical value of the property is demonstrated by the Thornhill Club and its built heritage \nresources of the Mortimer House, the Rankin House, and the Langstaff House. Constructed in 1834 for  Thornhill’s first Anglican rector the Reverend George Mortimer, the Mortimer House is an early and locally unique example of a residence built in the Georgian-style with Neo-classical influences. The  Rankin House, an Ontario Gothic Cottage constructed between 1879 and 1884, and the Langstaff House, constructed by Josephine Langstaff between 1918- 1921, both are representative examples of their respective architectural styles.\n\nThe design value or physical value of the Thornhill Club lies in its numerous landscape elements that reflect Stanley W. Thompson’s high degree of artistic merit in golf course design. The elevated tees, strategic bunkers, and subtly breaking greens, the Gourlay range, outdoor practice putting green, aerial tram, circulation routes, mature trees, and maintained gardens that Thompson laid out in 1922 all reflect his ten guiding design principles for golf course design. While the Thornhill Club has been evolved to meet the needs of the current membership, the historical layout and features developed by Thompson retain a high degree of integrity and are discernible throughout the property.\n\nThe historical value of the property is linked to its direct associations with several important 19th century people and families, including Benjamin Thorne (the founder of the Village of Thornhill), Reverend George Mortimer (first Anglican rector), and the locally respected Bell, Rankin, and Langstaff families. The property also has a direct association with Stanley W. Thompson, a Canadian golf course architect active between 1912 and 1953 and a founding member of the American Society of Golf Course Architects. This historical association is important at a provincial level —of the 83 courses Thompson designed in Ontario, the Thornhill Club is considered one of 30 ‘Level One’ category courses where Thompson was the primary designer and architect. For his extensive body of work in Canada and internationally Thompson is recognized as a Person of National Significance by the Historic Sites and \nMonuments Board of Canada.\n\nThe contextual value of the property lies in its collection of 19th century built heritage resources of Mortimer House, Rankin House, and Langstaff House in the picturesque and greenspace setting of the Thornhill Club. In the broader surroundings these buildings and the golf course contribute to the Thornhill Vaughan Heritage Conservation District, and the Thornhill Club is visually and spatially linked \nto The Ladies Golf Club of Toronto across Yonge Street to the east and the Uplands Golf Course is located directly to the north. Both golf courses were designed by Stanley Thompson in 1924 and 1937, respectively. Additionally, Mortimer House and the property’s former location as ‘the North Hill’ where Benjamin Thorne’s mills formed the nucleus of the settlement of Thornhill, are considered by the community to be local landmark.\n\n",

It sits on the northeastern edge of the town of Uxbridge, Ontario, between Main Street and Lakeridge Road. The property consists of a former wooden railway bridge and the steep treed banks on either side of the Uxbridge\nBrook. The Bridge is the only structure on the property. It was originally constructed in 1870-1 as a railway bridge for the narrow-gauge Toronto & Nipissing Railway (T&NR). It is an 8-span pile trestle constructed of large timber piles connected to one another in frames. Each frame is stabilized with cross braces attached with iron rods and bolts. The Bridge is approximately 38 metres long, 3.6 metres wide, and 8 metres high (as measured from the centre of the creek bed to the deck). The trestle form and wood construction of the bridge are its most distinguishing characteristics. Most of the wood has been replaced, either section by section or piece by piece, over time. The superstructure above the piles is composed on wood and hardware from the 20th century. The frames have retained their original configurations, but new bracing has been added and timber piles were almost certainly replaced.

It is located at mile 15.4 on the Metrolinx Barrie Rail Line, just south of Langstaff Road and between Keele and Dufferin streets. The culvert property is Lot 10, Concession 3, City of Vaughan.\nThe culvert is set within a railway embankment, and supports the rail line as it crosses the West Don River. It is located in the Langstaff industrial area of the City of Vaughan, and is flanked by a strip of municipal parkland that follows the river valley.\nThe culvert is comprised of a barrel vault and two portals, each with a spandrel wall and voussoired opening and flanked by retaining walls. It is made of Queenston limestone blocks, rough-faced on the spandrel and retaining walls, and smooth-faced on the barrel vault. The arch of the spandrel wall is formed by a series of rough-faced, voussoired blocks with trimmed edges. The date (1885) and builder (D. Carr) are carved into the central voussoir. The culvert is 37 metres (122 feet) long, with an opening\n4.6 x 5.5 metres (15 x 18 feet) in diameter.

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The West Don River Culvert is of cultural heritage value or interest because:\nIt is a fine, representative example of a stone-arch culvert, a type, material and construction method that was common for railway structures in the 19th century, but fell into disuse in the 20th century in favour of concrete culverts. It is rare or unique within the City of Vaughan, and the largest stone-arch culvert to survive on the Metrolinx Barrie line.\nThe precision and proportions of the cut-stone, Queenston limestone blocks, their assembly into a stone-arch structure, and their various finishes (rough-faced, smooth-faced and hammer-dressed) all exhibit a high degree of craftsmanship.\nThe West Don River Culvert is a well-crafted masonry structure that supports the rail line as it crosses\na small waterway, acts to retain the adjacent embankments, and is designed to maximize its strength and endurance. After more than 125 years in place, it continues to serve its original purpose. The retaining walls of the culvert’s eastern portal were repaired or replaced by concrete in 1955.\nThe West Don River Culvert has direct associations with the railway history of south-central Ontario. It was built by the Northern and Northwestern Railway (NNR) in 1885, on a route created by the Ontario Simcoe and Huron Railroad Union Company (OS&HRUC) in 1853. The culvert has been used by subsequent owners or operators of the railroad: Grand Trunk Railway (GTR), Canadian National Railways (CNR), VIA Rail, and Go Transit/Metrolinx.\nThe culvert was built by the NNR under the direction of Chief Engineer Joseph Hobson (1834-1917), who went on to become chief engineer of the GTR. Hobson had a long and distinguished career as a railway engineer, designing many major rail structures including the St. Clair River Tunnel. This is strikingly similar to other culverts designed by Hobson.\nThe culvert is an integral part of the historic rail line between Toronto and Barrie, which has been in continuous operation since 1853. It is historically and functionally connected with the rail crossing of the Don River.",

The run to Aurora in May 1853 initiated steam train service in Ontario (Canada West).\nFunctioning primarily as a freight line moving agricultural products to Toronto, the line quickly became known as ‘Oats, Straw and Hay’. Grain and lumber exports in the 1860s gave way to livestock shipping in the 1900s. Later, the draining of the Holland Marsh in the 1920s created a commercial market gardening industry in the area which made Bradford a major centre for fresh and frozen produce.\nThe current station building was constructed c1900 as part of GTR expansion and upgrading of rail facilities across Ontario. In its design and functionality, the station building represents a ‘combination’ building which was intended to serve freight and commuter traffic.\nThe station has been used by successive rail companies between 1853 and present day and as a result, the station property is historically, visually, functionally linked to its surrounding, including the rail tracks.",

Beautifully restored, it retains most of its key original features. It is one of only two such stations with original features that are known to still be in service as a railway station.\nThe Aurora GO Station property is directly associated with the construction and operation of the Ottawa, Simcoe and Huron Union Railroad Company, which operated the first steam\nrailway in Canada West. Aurora marked the terminus of the first leg of the steam railway, opened in May 1853. The Aurora GO Station property is directly associated with the\ninauguration of the first steam train in Canada West, which carried out its first journey, from Toronto to Aurora, on 16 May 1853.\nThe Aurora GO Station displays a high degree of craftsmanship in its Stick Style features and finishes, including gable peaks with bargeboard decoration, projecting operator’s bay, open porte-cochère with wooden pillars, exterior framing and paneling, and interior paneling.\nThe Aurora GO Station is the key resource that defines the railway character of the area. It supports the 19th century character of the neighbourhood to the west and north of the station.\nThe Aurora GO Station is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to the railway tracks and to the Railway Hotel, built in 1856 on the north side of Wellington Street East. A railway has operated on this site since 1853.\nThe Aurora GO Station operates as a landmark within the Town of Aurora. It is a highly visible reminder of the town's 160-year-old railway heritage, and a key focus for the town's current importance as a commuter suburb. It reflects the high value placed on heritage preservation by the town and citizens.\nThe Aurora GO Station is of provincial significance because it has a strong association with an event of importance to the province.

The original structure, designed by George Albert Bachmann and Abe Wilson, was completed in 1932 and represents Forest Hill’s development as an independent village. This original portion holds the building’s primary architectural and historical value. The first addition was completed in 1937 by Page & Steele, reflecting the shift from a volunteer fire department to a permanent force that was necessitated by Forest Hill’s growth. The addition’s design is a successful iteration of the original building with regard to details and construction method. The second extension was completed by J.G. Sutherland in 1971 to accommodate new use by the City of Toronto, which had annexed Forest Hill in 1967. While the second addition does not share the first two structures’ solid masonry\nconstruction, it is a well-executed addition that closely harmonizes with the details of the original building and first addition.",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The heritage value of the property at 641 Eglinton Avenue West lies in its design value as representative of Forest Hill’s high architectural standards, its historical associations with the development of Forest Hill, and its contextual value as a civic landmark.\nThe building expresses the residential character and scale of the surrounding Forest Hill neighbourhood. This distinctive character results from the architectural standards held by the Village, which were codified in its early laws. In 1933, Council declared that all houses to be built in Forest Hill must have the front elevation designed by an architect, which effectively produced the highest proportion of architect-designed houses in any Canadian municipality. Council set up a Board of Architects in 1936 to further regulate the approval process for new construction.\nIn terms of historic value the original portion of the building represents the Village’s operation as an independent municipality. The first addition manifests the civic needs of the growing Village in the late 1930s. The second addition was a product of the City of Toronto’s adaptation of Forest Hill’s civic resources after annexing the Village in 1967. As such, it relates to City of Toronto’s growth at that time, as opposed to the growth of Forest Hill that was reflected in the original building and first addition. As exemplified by the original construction and echoed in the two sympathetic additions, the building demonstrates Forest Hill’s legislated principles of promoting architectural excellence and aesthetic consistency throughout the neighbourhood. The original (1932) portion of the building demonstrates the work of George Albert Bachmann and Abe Wilson, two noteworthy architects who are otherwise not known to have collaborated. The architect of the first addition (1937), Page & Steele Architects, is a prominent Toronto-based firm that was established in 1926 and remains active. The second addition (1971) was designed by J.G. Sutherland, the city architect of Toronto and designer of such buildings as the St. Lawrence Market North Building. The engagement of the in-house architect on this project stood in contrast with the original building and first addition, which called upon prominent architects in private practice.\nThe property is contextually significant in reflecting and supporting the scale and aesthetic character of the residential neighbourhood to the south. This character is quintessential to Forest Hill. The building’s position on the south side of Eglinton reflects the course of Forest Hill’s evolution: residential development was bounded by Eglinton to the north until after 1930, and commercial and civic buildings were constructed along Eglinton. Due to the quality of its architectural design and its continuous use as Forest Hill’s fire station since 1932, the building is highly recognized within the local community and thus holds landmark status.",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The Cherry Street Interlocking Tower and its immediate site is a property of Provincial cultural heritage value due to its context, historical associations, design and technical achievement. The tower is part of a unique cultural landscape – the Union Station Railway Corridor. The corridor is one of the main influences in the structure of the broader Toronto urban region. Key elements of the corridor include Union Station and its associated buildings, the three interlocking towers, the raised viaduct and the USRC subways and bridges. The USRC is associated with the growth and apotheosis of railway\nservices and technologies in Ontario and Canada. The features also help establish recognition of the corridor as a historic resource in the city of Toronto.\nHistorically, the building is associated with railway architecture in general and, more specifically, to the CPR’s long legacy of producing some of Canada’s most important and celebrated architectural works in the areas of transportation and industry in all provinces, including Ontario. For the Cherry Street Tower, CP designed a building that was perfectly suited to its technical function and shared the noble masonry detailing and building silhouette common to the other Towers in this part of the corridor. The tower also served an important role in showcasing commitments to rail safety and helped mark the entry to one of Canada’s most important landmarks in the early 20th century – Toronto’s Union Station. The Cherry Street Tower is also a fully intact workplace dating from 1931. Workers who operated and maintained the interlocking system were part of a relatively small, but highly\nspecialized, trade that sought recognition as a distinct category of railway worker.\nThe Cherry Street Tower was one of three buildings conceived as a set to house expensive and technically sophisticated interlocking equipment, and to ensure the safe operation of trains.\nFunctionally, the tower was designed to provide maximum visibility outwards to the rail corridor and to provide spaces and finishes required to segregate and protect specialized equipment and work procedures. Without the interlocking equipment and the services of signaling staff, the safe and efficient operation of trains in the busy corridor would have been impossible. The equipment also\nprovides evidence that interlocking technology was sufficiently developed and proven in the 1920s that\nit was able to remain in use for many decades.\nThe lower level of the Cherry Street Interlocking Tower also marks the original street level almost at the grade of Lake Ontario’s shoreline.",

In 1909, the Board of Railway Commissioners ordered the GTR and the City of Toronto to jointly complete a grade separation project on the portion of the GTR line between downtown Toronto and New Toronto. The project eliminated all thirteen level crossings on the route and increased the number of tracks from two to four. The new crossings at Dufferin, Dunn, Jameson and Dowling Avenues were to have overhead bridges to carry vehicular and pedestrian traffic while the remaining crossings were to have subways to carry vehicles and pedestrians. The overhead bridges were designed by the GTR in conformance with the City of Toronto’s General Specifications for Bridges and Viaducts (1909).\nThe grade separation project was a significant engineering work for the GTR and the City. Commencing in 1910 the project required extensive excavation, grading, construction of temporary and permanent bridges, production of tons of steel, laying of pavement, stone and track. Completed in 1912, the project noticeably changed the area along its 10-kilometre route. The cutting for the new tracks not only required removal of several houses, but resulted in a steep embankment which exists today.\nThe Dunn Avenue bridge is one of the defining features of the rail landscape created by the grade separation project. It is an integral part of the historic rail line between Toronto and Hamilton which has been in continuous use since 1855. The bridge is historically and functionally connected with the rail crossing over the GO Transit Lakeshore West corridor, continuing in its original use for over 100 years.",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The Dowling Avenue bridge is of cultural heritage value for its historic and contextual values.\nThe Dowling Avenue bridge (built 1910-12) is associated with the Grand Trunk Railway’s (GTR)/City of Toronto grade separation project which was required as a result of increased freight and passenger traffic. In 1909, the Board of Railway Commissioners ordered the GTR and the City of Toronto to jointly complete a grade separation project on the portion of the GTR line between downtown Toronto and New Toronto. The project eliminated all thirteen level crossings on the route and increased the number of tracks from two to four. The new crossings at Dufferin, Dunn, Jameson and Dowling Avenues were to have overhead bridges to carry vehicular and pedestrian traffic while the remaining crossings were to have subways to carry vehicles and pedestrians. The overhead bridges were designed by the GTR in conformance with the City of Toronto’s General Specifications for Bridges and\nViaducts (1909).\nThe grade separation project was a significant engineering work for the GTR and the City.\nCommencing in 1910 the project required extensive excavation, grading, construction of temporary and permanent bridges, production of tons of steel, laying of pavement, stone and track. Completed in 1912, the project noticeably changed the area along its 10-kilometre route. The cutting for the new tracks not only required removal of several houses, but resulted in a steep embankment which exists today.\nThe Dowling Avenue bridge is one of the defining features of the rail landscape created by thegrade separation project. It is an integral part of the historic rail line between Toronto and Hamilton which has been in continuous use since 1855. The bridge is historically and functionally connected with the rail crossing over the GO Transit Lakeshore West corridor, continuing in its original use for over 100 years.",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The heritage value of the property at 1300 Eglinton Avenue West lies in its design value as an exemplary modernist transit hub, its historical associations with citizen lead reactive planning of the late 1970s with specific association with the Spadina Expressway controversy and the development of the Spadina subway line, and its contextual value as a landmark site and a functional link between\ndowntown Toronto and the city’s northwestern suburbs.\nThe property exhibits a high degree of artistic merit in its elegant modernist design and is a representative example of the use of architectural concrete, most notably in its octagonal, concrete waffle-slab roof. Two enamel murals by Gerald Zeldin, called “Summertime Streetcar,” are\nprominently featured at track level. They represent the TTC’s efforts to increase the aesthetic quality of\nsubway stations for the Spadina line through the commission of site-specific artwork that was highly integrated with the stations’ architecture.\nIn terms of historic value, the property is highly representative of significant mid-century developments in Toronto’s transportation system. The roots of the Spadina subway line, of which the subject property is a part, lay in a long-discussed proposal for a Spadina Expressway that would link downtown Toronto with the city’s northwestern suburbs. This proposal culminated in a fierce debate between downtown residents and politicians. As a result, Eglinton Avenue (and eventually Eglinton West Station) marked the southern end of the expressway, ultimately named Allen Road. The Spadina subway line became a priority after 1967, when the suburban municipalities gained a majority on City Council. The structural design of Eglinton West Station, which is partially above-ground and partially below, reflects the transition of the Spadina line from an underground tunnel south of Eglinton to an at-grade construction to the north, where it is situated within the median of the Allen. Additionally, the property demonstrates the work of Arthur Erickson, a highly acknowledged modernist architect whose oeuvre holds national significance. The selection of Erickson for Eglinton West and Yorkdale stations reflected the TTC’s efforts to heighten the profile of the Spadina subway line through individualized station designs by prominent architects.\nThe station holds contextual value through its integral connection to not only its immediate surroundings but also the outlying region of Toronto’s suburbs, by means of its relationship to the Spadina subway and Allen Road. The property defines the character of the southern entrance to the Allen expressway, and relates to the manufactured landscape that incorporates the rail infrastructure in\nBen Nobleman Park on the south side of Eglinton. Due to the superior quality of its design, the prominence and high visibility of its unusual site, and its functional and historical significance as a transportation hub, the property is a landmark.",

        "Description of Property:": "The former Eglinton Bus Terminal consists of ten parallel bus bays, situated at an angle to Eglinton, and an outbuilding on axis with Eglinton. Of the bays, Platforms 1 through 9 are identical, and each features a wall with translucent windows, a shallow canopy, a single bus lane with unloading and loading areas, and a staircase leading to a subterranean system of cross-passages to the main bus\nconcourse. Black and grey wall tiles were a part of a later modification, and glass block was eventually replaced with standard, translucent windows. The tenth bay, Platform 10 at the west end, was constructed concurrently with Platforms 1 through 9 but follows a noticeably different design, with a deeper canopy, columns with stainless steel detailing, and four stopping positions for buses. At the\nfar west end of the site, a brick outbuilding contains Platforms 11 through 13, which have not been used regularly since the early 1970s. The platforms share a common roof that acts as a canopy for Platform 11 and fully covers Platforms 12 and 13. The outbuilding retains glass block windows similar to those that were eventually removed from the bus bays.\nSince the TTC decommissioned the bus bays and outbuilding in 2004, the site has lain behind a chainlink fence, closed to the public. Largely due to disuse, portions of the former bus terminal site are in poor condition. In particular, the painted plaster walls within the bus shelters have significantly deteriorated, and the subterranean tunnels connecting the bus bays have experienced severe water damage. However, the brick, glass blocks in the bus garage, tiles in the bus bays, and metal fixtures remain generally intact.\nThe subway station contains shops and restaurants located on a concourse level that connects passengers to the bus terminal and entrances. Below, a single central platform services the northbound and southbound trains. In addition to the original Vitrolite tiles (refer to section 4.1), noteworthy material details include terrazzo floors and columns clad in stainless steel and red tiles, which date to\nthe 1980s restoration.\n2190 Yonge Street is a Metrolinx Heritage Property.",
        "Statement of Cultural Heritage Value or Interest:": "Key elements that define the heritage character of this site include the following:\n The site’s use as a transit hub\n The spatial arrangement and layout of parallel bays with individual canopies\n The formal relationship between the subway station concourse, passages, and lower platform level, and between the parallel bus bays\n The configuration of the subway station’s entrances, with their integration into commercial buildings at all four corners of the intersection of Yonge and Eglinton\n The site’s sophisticated spatial arrangement, including the paths of passenger circulation in the concourse and through a series of connected subterranean passages\n The buildings’ style elements, finishes, and details that are rare examples of the TTC’s early bus terminal design and original subway station template, as well as examples of the TTC’s approach to station renovation, such as the following:\no Bus terminal buildings: platform canopies; original signage; stainless steel detailing and fixtures\no Subway station: finishes of the concourse; terrazzo floors; original signage and use of typeface; most significantly, Vitrolite tiles that either remain in their original locations or were salvaged from other locations to replace broken tiles in the mid-1980s",
        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The heritage value of the properties at 2190 and 2200 Yonge Street (including the Eglinton Subway Station and former Bus Terminal) lie in their architectural value as a relatively intact example of the original Yonge Subway station design template, their historical associations with Toronto’s evolving transit system and northward development, and their contextual value as a transit hub.\nThe station has undergone renovations to reconfigure passageways and entrances and to accommodate the site’s evolving context within an emerging commercial core. However, it holds design value as a representative of the original design template for the stations along the Yonge subway line.\nFurthermore, it is the only one of these stations to have largely retained the original Vitrolite tiles that\ncharacterized the interior design. The nine identical bus terminal buildings demonstrate a design for a multimodal hub – particularly notable for the inclusion of parallel platforms with individual canopies – that is not seen elsewhere in Toronto’s transit system, and the tenth bay was designed in conjunction with them. The outbuilding, which was constructed later according to a more conventional design and was utilized regularly for only a limited time, holds less relative significance.\nIn terms of historic value, the subway station and bus terminal buildings are directly associated with the\nevolution of Toronto’s transit system and the city’s pattern of northward development. Constructed along with the subway, the bus terminal buildings are a remnant of the site’s long history as a busy transit hub servicing streetcars and buses. They provide the only exterior, street-level identification of the site’s heritage as such. The subway station was the original terminus of the Yonge line, which was the first subway in Canada. It marked the convergence of several streetcar and bus routes with the\nsubway line, and served as a link between downtown Toronto and the northern suburbs. As the city spread northward, and Yonge and Eglinton evolved as a commercial centre, Eglinton Station’s role was adjusted. The subway line was extended beyond Yonge and Eglinton, and new entrances to the subway\nwere integrated into the commercial buildings that arose at this important intersection. In addition to these thematic associations, the architect of the subway station, John B. Parkin & Associates, is a prolific, Toronto-based firm that was highly influential in Canada’s adaptation of the Modern\nmovement. It focused on institutional and public commissions and remains active.\nThe site has contextual value through its function as a transit hub. As such, it has played a significant role in shaping the immediate context of Yonge and Eglinton, first by serving as a gateway to the city’s northern suburbs, then catalyzing mixed-use development in response to rapid transit, and now facilitating access to a regionally significant commercial core. The station is integrally linked – physically, functionally, visually, and historically – not only to its immediate surroundings but to the entire Yonge subway line. The subway station is one of the most highly trafficked stations within Toronto’s transit system, and has been in continuous use as a station since the city’s subway first opened. While the landmark status of the bus terminal buildings is tempered by their poor physical condition, they currently act as a highly visible and distinctive cultural landscape within the urban\nfabric of Yonge and Eglinton.",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The Scott Street Interlocking Tower and its immediate site is a property of Provincial cultural heritage value due to its context, historical associations, design and technical achievement. The tower is part of a unique cultural landscape – the Union Station Railway Corridor. The corridor is one of the main influences in the structure of the broader Toronto urban region. Key elements of the corridor include Union Station and its associated buildings, the three interlocking towers, the raised viaduct and the USRC subways and bridges. The features also help establish recognition of the corridor as a historic\nresource in the city of Toronto.\nHistorically, the building is associated with railway architecture in general and, more specifically, to the CPR’s long legacy of producing some of Canada’s most important and celebrated architectural works in the areas of transportation and industry in all provinces, including Ontario. For the Scott Street Tower, CP designed a building that was perfectly suited to its technical function and shared the noble masonry detailing and building silhouette common to the other Towers in this part of the corridor. The tower also served an important role in showcasing commitments to rail safety and marking the entry to one of Canada’s most important landmarks in the early 20th century – Toronto’s Union Station. The Scott Street Tower is also a fully intact workplace dating from 1931. Workers whooperated and maintained the interlocking system were part of a relatively small, but highly specialized,\ntrade that sought recognition as a distinct category of railway worker.\nThe Scott Street Tower was one of three buildings conceived as a set to house expensive and technically sophisticated interlocking equipment, and to ensure the safe operation of trains.\nFunctionally, the tower was designed to provide maximum visibility outwards to the rail corridor and to provide spaces and finishes required to segregate and protect specialized equipment and work procedures. Without the interlocking equipment and the services of signaling staff, the safe and efficient operation of trains in the busy corridor would have been impossible. The equipment also\nprovides evidence that interlocking technology was sufficiently developed and proven in the 1920s that\nit was able to remain in use for many decades. The lower level of the Scott Street Interlocking Tower also marks the original street level almost at the grade of Lake Ontario’s shoreline.",

        "Description of Heritage Attributes:": "The provincial heritage value of the Hamilton GO Centre (former TH&B Station), constructed in 1933,\nlies in its architectural design, its relationship to the character of downtown Hamilton, and its historical associations as a major station and headquarters of a significant regional railway line.\nThe Toronto, Hamilton & Buffalo (TH&B) Station set a precedent as one of the earliest and most\nlauded examples of the Art Moderne style in Canada. (See John Blumenson, Ontario Architecture: A\nGuide to Styles and Building Terms, and Shannon Ricketts et al., A Guide to Canadian Architectural\nStyles). Designed by the renowned firm of Fellheimer and Wagner, the development of the building’s\nsize, height, and materials during the design and subsequent construction phases reflected the effects of\nthe Great Depression. The building’s steel frame construction represented technical\ninnovation at the time, and its materiality and lack of ornament marked a bold departure from typical\nrailway station design.\nDue to its prominent siting on axis with Hughson Street, the station has remained a visual landmark in\ndowntown Hamilton. The station’s construction was associated with the TH&B’s technologically\nadvanced grade separation project, which eliminated disruptive level crossings throughout downtown\nHamilton. The resulting elevated tracks provide a visual link between the station and its immediate setting, and act as a relative boundary between downtown Hamilton to the north and the largely residential architecture to the south.\nBuilt at the height of passenger rail operations, the TH&B Station saw its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s, with business shifting to focus on freight services in the 1950s and 1960s. Throughout this time period, as in the four decades preceding the station’s construction, the TH&B Railway played a significant role in the industrial development of Hamilton and the surrounding region.",

OPGS was a forerunner to modern generating stations and was the first to incorporate automation and safety measures. The OPGS was constructed by the Ontario Power Company on lands controlled by the NPC. Ownership was transferred to the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, the predecessor to Ontario Hydro, in 1917.\n\nThe OPGS was designed to reflect the mission of the NPC, established in 1885, which is to protect and promote the natural and cultural heritage of the Niagara River corridor. The OPGS powerhouse reflects this through its understated design and simple concrete façade, as well as its positioning at the base of the Niagara Gorge where spray from the falls partially obscures the façade. Not visible from the Canadian side, its view from the United States or tour boats maintains the scale and visuals of the natural rock walls. The gate house, forebay, elevator building, and surge tanks were integrated into the parkland surrounding the falls. The underground tunnels constructed to supply water to the OPGS from the gate house were the largest ever constructed at that time, although completely hidden underground.

The York Beltline is also physically and historically linked to its surrounding, following the right-of-way of the former Toronto Beltline Railway which influenced the development of this inner-suburb of Toronto. When Metrolinx acquires property for the purposes of the Caledonia GO Station, those lands can be considered to be a provincial heritage property. The York Beltline Trail, and any future provincial land holdings within its boundaries, do not hold provincial significance and are not considered a provincial heritage property of provincial significance.",
